I've always enjoyed writing about my life; for me, journaling and blogging are predominantly ways of processing and recording my experiences for myself. Writing not only helps me understand what's happening to me, it provides opportunities to look back and reflect on the lessons I've learned and the ways I've grown.

This is a literal depiction of me rereading my journal entries from 2015.

Unfortunately, the opposite is true as well, and I also notice the thought patterns I seem to have been stuck in for years. One example of this is my preoccupation with fear. When I was in first year struggling with moving to a new school and developing new friendships, I listened to a song called "[Haunt // Bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPTODlxP9x0)" by the 1975 over and over because half of it is just the line "I'm not scared". For some reason, I convinced myself that if I wrote and thought that line enough, it would somehow make it true.

Fast forward nearly four years and I'm still scared -- of the future, of rejection, of inadequacy, of honesty. I think the difference between then and now is that I've learned something new about fear: it's not about being unafraid, but rather about facing fear and carrying on with my life despite my fear. There are certainly things I've learned to become more comfortable with, like managing my own finances or meeting new people, but in general learning how to _deal with fear_ has been more useful than just trying not to be scared.

One aspect of my life that I'm actively trying to change (and pretty proud of the progress I've made so far!) is my apprehension around honest, direct communication. I've always been a bit conflict avoidant and am naturally inclined to worry and stress about relationships, but recently I've made a conscious effort to say what I truly mean even if I'm scared of the reaction I'll receive. Working on this trait has shown me that there are obvious ways that I can simplify my life if I'm willing to pluck up the nerve to try them.

Right now I'm hiding from some things in my life that terrify me. Instead of hiding, I should be doing something about them -- especially armed with the knowledge that many of them are likely more frightening in my head than they are in reality. I think that being brave is yet another thing that's much more difficult than it sounds, but after finishing _Frankenstein_ and _Crime and Punishment_ in my literature class, both of which feature main characters consumed with fear, I know that I'll be much better off when I finally step out in courage.
