I've decided to try something new today - instead of a coherent post in the style I usually write, I've typed up a stream-of-consciousness style journal entry that I wrote a couple weeks ago. (The text is exactly as I wrote it, unedited.) It's a reflection on memory and documentation, inspired by my time on Explore as I was thinking about being young and the memories and connections I seem to be constantly forming and dissolving.

My roommates and I went to the beach near the end of the program to swim in the Saint Lawrence.

> This is part of the pride of youth - you think that you will remember all of this, because you are important so everything that happens to you must also be important. Your grade on your test matters, and the amount of sugar you ate after dinner, and the exact number of minutes you slept, who you talked to, who knows you, what you said in class, these are of the utmost importance and they clog up your brain. There are things you can't help but photograph because they mean so much, like the exact colour of the sky as you stare at it changing or the stupid face your friend is making because nothing seems funnier. Maybe even more prideful are the things you refuse to record because they couldn't possibly slip out of your head, the sound of each others' voices or what the ceiling above your bed looks like or the way your parents look in the morning light.

> The problem when everything is significant is that it piles up on itself until the weakest pieces of the stack get crushed and lost until there's no recalling them, and it's only when you get glimpses of the inner details of your past life that you realize it meant everything to you back then and is now just a hazy space somewhere, that your friend's laughter and the number of stairs to your room have been forgotten even when they used to be part of your everyday. Although you try to hold onto the things that matter most, they can't help but slip through your fingers like sand.
