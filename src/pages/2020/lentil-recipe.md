If you know me, you'll know that I've been looking for a good lentil soup recipe for a long time.

The thing is, good recipes are hard to find. Some have been way too watery, others didn't have enough flavour. Well, the wait is finally over. I've found a recipe that's easy and delicious and in my good fortune have decided to share it with you all.

_Actually, this is an anticipatory post. I haven't actually tried the recipe yet. But I definitely intend to._
