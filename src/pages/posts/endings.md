One thing that I've realized is that endings take a long time. Last year when I was leaving Australia and this year as I've been finishing up my undergraduate degree, I've really seen how the process of finishing something is exactly that: a process, often an involved one.

A lesson that I took away from exchange, though, is that rushing the process by starting it early or trying to wrap it up too soon doesn't really help.

**It seems to me that it's best if I let it happen naturally and deal with it according to my own judgment, rather than what I think I 'should' be doing.**

The question I've been asking myself lately is _when am I officially finished?_ Is it when I attend my last lecture, or write my last exam, or submit my last paper, or finish my capstone presentation, or move out of my house and leave my keys behind? Because if that's the case, then I'm already done.

If it's receiving my final grades, or going to my graduation ceremony, or hanging up my diploma on my wall, then this stage of life isn't finished until June.

And if it's saying goodbye forever to the friendships I've made and forgetting all the things I spent the last four years learning, then maybe I'll never be done with it &mdash; and honestly, I'm leaning towards this answer.

In late March I made it a resolution to not be preemptively sad about finishing school when I still had time to enjoy myself and see my friends. This helped me to make the most of the final month rather than dwelling on the impending future, but as a result I think that I denied myself a bit of space to process leaving university.

Yesterday, though, I really felt it hit me. On Monday I took the bus from Toronto back to Hamilton to do a final games night with some friends, but yesterday I had to watch them pack up and say goodbye, collect the remaining stuff from my house, and leave Hamilton for the indefinite future &mdash; in other words, it felt like I was finally leaving for real.

Even though I knew it was coming and I have confidence that I'll be able to make the most of my next season of life, it's still hard to say goodbye to the people and experiences that have hugely affected me over the past few years.

Today has been good because I carved out some space for myself just to process and reflect, which I think is healthy and necessary. As I've been reflecting, I realized something pretty cool.

At the beginning of this school year, I met up with my friend Andrew and we decided to go biking to a lookout near his house and read there for awhile. It was a nice evening to be outdoors and I wanted to make progress on _The Odyssey_, the first text that my literature course this year covered.

During Odysseus' trip to return to Ithaca, he stops at an island and stays with a nymph called Circe for a while before continuing on his journey.

Yesterday, on my final day in Hamilton, Andrew and I went biking again but this time further along the water to a different park. Strangely enough, it turned out that I was just starting _Circe_ by Madeline Miller, which is the story of that same nymph from _The Odyssey_ including but definitely not limited to her perspective on her time with Odysseus.

Although unplanned, it felt symmetrical to start and finish the year with two days that mirrored each other, but in another sense that my ending was a reimagining and an extension of what I had started with. It felt right to go past what I had already done, remember that it was good, and then head on to something better.

I was thinking about this blog post as I waited for the bus in Hamilton that would take me to Toronto. When the bus pulled up, I slipped off my headphones in case I needed to communicate with the driver, and right before I got on the bus I heard someone yelling my name.

I looked up just as a car drove through the intersection - a friend that I had taken a few computer science classes with was hanging out of the passenger window, yelling my name and waving goodbye to me.

Being in my head for a while is a good thing, but if I spend too long in there I'm more likely to miss the cool, unexpected things that the future has in store for me.

The trick is figuring out the balance, and I think that's a challenge I'm ready to take on.
