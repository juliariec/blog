For the last two weeks, I've been in a small town in Quebec called Trois Pistoles participating in the Explore program, which sends anglophone students to francophone regions (and vice versa) to encourage young Canadians to learn the other national language.

Since I had no pressing plans after I finished school, I decided that it would be a beneficial use of my time to improve my French competency &mdash; the last time I studied French was ninth grade, so I was definitely rusty.

The program aims to teach the four different language competencies &mdash; speaking, listening, reading, and writing &mdash; through the immersion experience, enrollment in a daily French course, and assorted Quebecois cultural activities.

Since I've already had a couple experiences of living in a new place and meeting new people, my personal goal here is to really improve at French. Something I hadn't thought of prior to my arrival is that each language competency demands very different things from prospective learners.

The strength of the immersion program is definitely that it improves one's speaking and listening skills because it demands correct pronunciation, a strong grasp of common vocabulary, and the ability to understand the meaning of natural spoken French.

I perceive this to be more of a 'top-down' approach to learning French, where through attempting to decode others' thoughts and express my own I learn how to communicate in French.

In contrast, my learning in class and my own personal studying have been primarily focused on reading and writing French, which seems to be a 'bottom-up' strategy. Instead of learning how to say specific things (like "I'm going to the school on my bike"), I can focus more on how sentence structure works, how to accord adjectives with nouns, and how to conjugate tenses.

There are definitely times where I wish the class was occasionally in English so that I could relate what I'm learning about French grammar to what I already know about English grammar, but overall I've been enjoying the classes even more than conversations.

I also feel that my reading and writing competencies are higher, so I prefer employing them.

Although I find the speaking and listening challenging, I see the value it adds to my learning because the reoccurring problem of having ideas to express but not the capacity to communicate them in French provides motivation for expanding my vocabulary and mastering the conjugation of certain verbs in specific tenses.

I also know that for skills like pronunciation it's impossible to get better unless I practice actually speaking French. Even though I'm by no means great at French, I can tell that I'm improving, which makes me happy. It's also necessary for communicating with the French-speaking locals here, which is further motivation to improve.

On my first weekend in Trois Pistoles I went for a hike at a nearby national park. While I was hiking, I was thinking to myself: _How can I communicate my experience of trying to learn a new language in a new place?_ The analogy I came up with actually resembles the Explore program (and exchange!) a bit.

For me, learning French is like moving from a big house you've lived in your whole life to a tiny apartment in a different country with only a backpack.

You have the bare essentials that you know you'll use all the time, like your cell phone and your laptop and a few of your favourite clothes &mdash; these are the things drilled into you in elementary school, like the colours, numbers, and how to conjugate the verbs Ãªtre and avoir.

When you arrive at your apartment, you have a sense of the other things you'll need to acquire (linens, dishes, clothes for every type of weather), but as you try living there you realize you need way more things than you thought you would &mdash; these are all the adjectives and verbs you never knew you used until you tried to say them in French, like 'dark' and 'to wake up'.

When you try to make do without them, like eating every meal in a bowl because you have no plates or speaking exclusively in the present tense because you don't know past tense, you see that it's not a very sustainable way to live.

In your new city, you also realize that you have no idea how to do the things you're used to doing &mdash; you don't have any spices so you can't cook the meals you want to eat, you don't have a gym membership so you can't work out, etc. &mdash; but that it makes no sense to start with those when there are so many essentials that are more pressing.

These are the complicated sentence structures and abstract ideas that you no longer have the language or understanding for but that don't pose an immediate challenge for functioning in everyday life.

Finally, though, once you furnish your apartment with the basics and figure out how to get to the subway station and grocery store, you get excited about living in a new place for a little bit, and you recognize that you're a bit more capable than you thought you'd be.

I think this is the stage of the analogy that I'm at right now, or maybe just approaching it.

So far it's been a challenge, but I've been enjoying it, and honestly the experience of knowing so little has been humbling (and probably therefore beneficial) for me. Sometimes, too, I find myself surprised by how simple it can be to communicate.

Whenever my roommates and I don't know what to say, we just say "C'est bon" (which means "It's good") &mdash; and honestly, almost all of the time it works!
