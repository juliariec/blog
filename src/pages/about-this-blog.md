This blog is my attempt at carving out a space of simplicity, reflection, and insight that I can share with other people. It's still a work in progress, but my hope is that its personality will begin to emerge as I write more and add to it.

This website has:

- **Privacy-focused analytics**. I initially didn't want to include any analytics, but I've realized that seeing that people read my blog is a huge source of motivation for me. The site uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) analytics, which is [privacy-focused](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) and doesn't track any identifying information about its users. The sole purpose is to see which posts (if any) are of interest to my audience.
- **No advertisements or affiliate links**. I'm not really interested in encouraging people to buy things. If you would like to support the blog, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/juliariec), but making money is not the purpose of this blog.

The code for this site lives on my [Github repo](https://github.com/juliariec/juliariec.com). It's written with React and SCSS using Gatsby and deployed on Netlify.

The idea for its current implementation and for parts of its philosophy come from [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/), whose blog I discovered at the beginning of my professional development career and greatly admire.
