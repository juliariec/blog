- Participating in EA Cambridge's [AGI Safety Fundamentals](https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals) program ([governance](https://www.eacambridge.org/ai-governance-curriculum) track).
- Training for my second sprint triathlon in June.
- Trying (and failing) to read the books on my physical bookshelf so I can give them away afterwards.

#### What is this page?

It's inspired by [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/about): "Think of what you'd tell a friend you hadn't seen in a year."
