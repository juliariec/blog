- Working as a software engineer at [System](https://about.system.com/about/overview) &mdash; [check it out](https://www.system.com/graph).
- Enjoying my summer in the 6ix: cycling around, reading at the park, meeting friends, etc.
- Training for my second sprint triathlon in ~~June~~ August!
- Preparing to relocate to New York City in September.
- Reading the books on my physical bookshelf so I can give them away when I'm done.

#### What is this page?

It's inspired by [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/about): "Think of what you'd tell a friend you hadn't seen in a year."
