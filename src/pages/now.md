- Living in Brooklyn and working as a software engineer at [System](https://www.system.com/graph).
- Meditating weekly with our 'plant room' group in the [Evolving Ground](https://www.evolvingground.org/) practice.
- Getting back into practicing yoga and Pilates more regularly.
- Looking forward to weekend trips to Chicago and Charlotte in the coming months.
- Considering doing another blog re-design...

#### What is this page?

It's inspired by [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/about): "Think of what you'd tell a friend you hadn't seen in a year."
