There's a song called "[Maps for the Getaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DwwyEuiF3o)" off a CD that Louise recently purchased that has lately become one of my favourite songs to listen to. I just returned from a road trip, so the lyrics of the song are even more relatable than they were before.

I think my favourite lines from the song are the following:

> _Lights that used to blind us_
>
> _Somehow they will guide us through the night._

I'm not sure what the songwriters intended when they wrote these lyrics, but I think they're powerful and they definitely made me think. The song is both nostalgic and hopeful, and these two lines really combine these two ideas.

It's a comfort to me to know that the obstacles and challenges I face right now are things that will eventually not only cease to be obstacles but actually help me on my life's journey, if you will. It's like the sun - driving home in the afternoon, it causes you to squint, but when night falls you realize that despite that hour of painfulness, the light it's provided has guided you the entire day.

It's also a reminder that everything I experience contains two sides. In class today we read a poem that described time as "judging" and "sparing". Time has the power to both condemn and save you, which is kinda crazy. It's similar to friendships - every human has both admirable traits and flaws, but the ones we enjoy spending time with are ones whose strengths we appreciate and flaws we can tolerate. It's up to us to use our judgment if the "good" side of people or experiences outweighs the "bad" one.

Another section of the song I love is:

> _Now that we're outside it_
>
> _I guess we survived it after all._

For high school especially I've noticed this - days can be tough, stressful, and overwhelming, but at the end of the year you look back and realize that you made it. You might even be better than when you started. This is another lesson to me: I'm trying to practice appreciating things in the moment, and not just when I'm outside them and looking back in on my own life.

This song reminds me of the good aspects of life without glossing over the bad ones. I love that music can enrich your current experiences and actually help you with past and future experiences as well. Although I'm approaching a time in life full of change, I'm reminded that life is good, and I'm going to be okay.
