A year ago today, I flew into Sydney for my semester on exchange to USyd! As a bit of a throwback to when I was living in Sydney, I wanted to share some of my top experiences while exploring the city. These are my top choices from everything I did, but within this list they're not ranked in any particular order. Where applicable I've tried to include (student) prices for the activities -- for the most part, they're either free, excluding transit costs, or relatively cheap, because Sydney has a lot of amazing things to do that cost very little! So without much further ado, here is my list, including some memories/photos from when I was there :)

### 1\. Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk

I found that no matter where I looked, this coastal walk was highly recommended as one of the best things to do while in Sydney; after going on it with my friends, I understood why. The city is renowned for its gorgeous beaches and this walk takes you through several -- plus, in terms of difficulty it's actually a pretty easy walk, especially if you take breaks. We did the walk in early March, so it was a beautiful hot day (around 30C) -- a couple degrees cooler would have been better, but it was still great. I liked that it finished at Coogee because it was an amazing beach and much less crowded than Bondi.

### 2\. Art Gallery of New South Wales

Students on a trip take notes on Mital Kerai's _"The man who sold the world"_ piece (see [here](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/insideartexpress/2018/mital_kerai/))

The Art Gallery of NSW is bigger than I imagined and had a variety of exhibits both times I visited (April and June in 2018). My favourite exhibit by far was ARTEXPRESS, which runs from early February to late April each year and features some fantastic student artwork. I loved that these pieces were accessible to someone like me who knows very little about art, and the talent and thought that the students put into the pieces was quite impressive. The second time I visited I saw an exhibit called [Superposition](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/21st-biennale-of-sydney/), which was part of an art event called the Biennale of Sydney which happens once every other year - so if you were to visit in 2020, 2022, ... I would also recommend checking that event out. The permanent gallery of the library was interesting enough, but I really liked the special exhibits for this art gallery.

### 3\. Pylon Lookout

View of Sydney Harbour from the top of Pylon Lookout

My friends and I went to this lookout on a bright Sunday morning in June and it was a fantastic outing. The lookout is part of the Harbour Bridge (and was actually a little challenging to find), but despite not looking very high it provided a great view of the city and harbour. The climb itself was short, and included some really interesting history about the bridge. I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Sydney - it was an inexpensive, enjoyable way to look out on the entire city!

### 4\. The Rocks Market

![](images/rocksmarket-1.jpg)

I tried Venezuelan arepas for the first time - delicious!

After the lookout, we walked down to the Rocks market, which runs on weekend mornings/afternoons in a historic area in Sydney. There were a variety of food trucks -- I had the arepas, my friend had a Japanese pancake, another friend tried crocodile skewers -- plus dozens of booths with handmade jewelry, expensive soaps, delicious local chocolate, you get the picture! We walked past musicians playing on the guitar and an artist working on a canvas using aerosol spray paint in front of a crowd... Basically, it's a market, so it has lots of cool things to see, taste, and listen to! Definitely a fun, relaxing way to spend late Sunday morning.

### 5\. Mahon Pool and Maroubra Beach

![](images/mahonpool-1.jpg)

Late morning at the pool -- the water was relatively calm and it wasn't too crowded yet!

Mahon Pool was a recommendation I found online when looking for outdoor pools in Sydney and it did not disappoint! It's technically a pool -- the bottom is concrete and it has 'shallow' and 'deep' ends -- but because it's right by the ocean, all the water in the pool comes from and flows back into the ocean. When we first arrived in the morning, it was high tide and way too choppy to enjoy, but we waited it out and the water calmed down enough to swim peacefully. There are also concrete blocks connected by chains that encircle the pool, and my friends and I amused ourselves by standing on the edge of the pool, hanging onto the chains as waves crashed into us -- it was surprisingly fun, and at times tricky to hold on! By early afternoon it was super crowded, so I would recommend going around 10AM or so. The pool is about a ten minute walk from Maroubra Beach, which is another large beach that's apparently also good for surfing, although we just swam, tanned, and played frisbee. There are some shops/places to eat nearby too, so we were able to spend the full day there. This outing was definitely one of my favourites from my entire exchange.

_No website needed, but both are easy to find on Google Maps (cost: free)_

### 6\. Royal Botanic Garden

Some gorgeous red flowers in the garden

Sydney has a large botanic garden right by the harbour which is definitely worth a visit; there's so much to see, and it's perfect for bringing a book and your lunch and just enjoying. This one feels pretty self-explanatory so I won't write too much, just that it's a really nice part of the city and worth checking out.

### 7\. Sydney Opera House

The Harbour Bridge and Opera House lit up at night

I don't think any trip to Sydney is complete without at least _looking_ at its iconic Opera House; to be fair, it's pretty difficult to miss. I really wanted to see at least one show inside the opera house when I was living in the city, and luckily I did some research and discovered that they sell student rush tickets for select performances at a very affordable price if you sign up for their newsletter (which you can do [here](https://www.sydneysymphony.com/concerts-and-tickets/booking-information/student-tickets) if you're interested). I got my tickets for $15 each last year, but it looks like they're $17 apiece now, which is still an excellent price. If you're a student, I would recommend making it out to a show or two if you get the chance -- I really enjoyed both performances I attended. If that's not your thing, they also do tours (which you have to pay for), or honestly you can just look at it for free and it's still cool.

### 8\. State Library of New South Wales

![](images/statelibrary.jpg)

The State Library of NSW was one of the first attractions I visited in the city!

One thing that I loved about Australia was that each state has a massive library that not only serves as a place to read and find books but also as a center for sharing local history and hosting events! New South Wales' library is not as visually interesting as the one in Victoria, but it's still worth a visit to learn a bit more about Sydney or to buckle down with some studying. In particular, I would recommend checking out the [World Press Photo Competition](https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/world-press-photo-exhibition-2019), which I think they host as an exhibition every year. When I attended in 2018, they had multiple rooms with huge, gorgeous prints of all the photos in the competition, accompanied by information about the photo and photographer; it was incredibly cool and I was super happy that I decided to check it out. The library also has visiting authors for events (which I think cost $10 or so), but although some looked really interesting unfortunately I couldn't make it out to any of them.

### 9\. Chinese Friendship Garden

![](images/friendshipgarden-1.jpg)

Thom and I spent an hour or so roaming around the garden at the beginning of exam period

One of Sydney's sister cities is Guangzhou, China, so it has a Chinese Friendship Garden located in the middle of the city as a way of commemorating its relationship with China. This garden is quite unusual because it's incredibly tranquil and lush against a classic urban backdrop, which actually makes the visit a bit disorienting. I think the garden is worth a visit because it's a peaceful break in a busy city and because the amount of thought and care that went into designing it is pretty astounding -- everything is in its place for a reason, and there's a lot of symbolism and meaning behind the contents of the garden. Overall, it was a relaxing and educational experience that I really enjoyed!

### 10\. White Rabbit Gallery

![](images/whiterabbit-1.jpg)

This is Liu Xiaodong's _"Weight of Insomnia"_, which uses a live video feed and a robotic brush to produce the painting (see [here](http://www.whiterabbitcollection.org/artists/liu-xiaodong-%E5%88%98%E5%B0%8F%E4%B8%9C/))

Last but definitely not least, the White Rabbit gallery is a small gallery of contemporary Chinese art located in Chippendale. It has some truly remarkable artwork, is small enough that it doesn't take long to see everything, and even has a tea shop on the first level with many different kinds of delicious tea and some snacks as well. I'm fairly unfamiliar with Chinese art so this gallery was an opportunity to see a lot more, plus the upper level has a library that my friends and I perused for a while where I was able to leaf through books explaining the history and meaning behind many of the pieces in the gallery. This was a less well known destination that I would recommend to anyone interested in learning more about art - plus, the tea was fantastic!

_Find more information about the gallery [here](http://www.whiterabbitcollection.org/) (cost: entry was free, pot of tea was ~$5 and worth it)_

Beyond this list, there are still so many more things to do in Sydney -- beaches, galleries, walks, parks -- that I haven't even mentioned! As you can tell, if you're a student there are some great discounts to take advantage of around the city, especially if you also get discounted transit fare with your concession card. If you're interested in finding more things to do around Sydney, there are a few websites that often post cool events or make lists of activities/places to visit. When I lived there, I routinely checked [The Urban List](https://www.theurbanlist.com/sydney), [TimeOut](https://www.timeout.com/sydney), [Broadsheet](https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney), and [Concrete Playground](https://concreteplayground.com/sydney) for ideas on what to do next.

I hope that this list has been either a useful resource for you as you plan your trip or an interesting insight into what there is to do in Sydney. If you've been before and have more ideas or suggestions, would love to hear them in the comments! I'm going to go back to studying, indoors, because instead of Australian summer I get Canadian winter this year... oh well :)
