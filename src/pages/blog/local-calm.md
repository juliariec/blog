Today is one of those days where my mind spends hours spinning, like I've kept it locked in a cage and now that it's out it just wants to race and scramble and roam. I love days like these, but they feel hard to come by; I've spent a significant portion of it listening to "[I'm with You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRR9ExA53Tc)" by Vance Joy on repeat and staring out my window.

Days like these also humble me because they remind me that there are so many experiences and emotions that I have no way of putting into words. I don't know what else to say, so I'll just share two quotes from novels I read this semester that have articulated what's in my head far better than I could.

The first quote, about a certain type of moment:

> It's a perfect June night. The smell of hot pavement gently subsides. Gnats come to fill the air. Mrs. Gutierrez emerges to sweep her stoop, then disappears back inside; minutes later, we hear her snores. This modest piece of local calm, sitting on a stoop after a family meal, I'm gripped with a strong deja vu. Those years I traveled abroad, moments like these felt commonplace, but this one feels impossibly rare. There's a word for this in Portuguese: _saudade_. It's not exactly nostalgia, there's more of a longing in it, for a feeling or way of life that may be impossible to recapture - that may or may not have even existed in the first place. "An indolent dreaming wistfulness" is how I've seen one writer describe it. Now _that's_ a great word.

And the second, about experiences with time:

> I kept thinking about the uneven quality of time -- the way it was almost always so empty, and then with no warning came a few days that felt so dense and alive and real that it seemed indisputable that that was what life was, that its real nature had finally been revealed. But then time passed and unthinkably grew dead again, and it turned out that that fullness had been an aberration and might never come back.

And now, back to my window :) Wishing you a restful weekend too.
