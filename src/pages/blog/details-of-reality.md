In my first year of university I can distinctly remember being asked if it was "what I expected" - and I can remember having no clue what to say, because I didn't know what to expect. I've been thinking about that again - the way that our expectations for the future are so vague, but how our everyday lives are so detailed that it's beyond our imagination altogether.

Let me try to explain this better. When I was thinking about my upcoming semester in Australia, I envisioned everything in these wide, sweeping terms, because I had no context for imagining what my new life would be like; and since I couldn't envision the details even remotely accurately, my thoughts were focused on the 'big picture' instead. This makes sense, because the 'big picture' is all that I can really get a hold on without more information. I've noticed that the questions people ask me about Sydney are usually these 'big picture' questions, like "Is Australia very different than Canada?" or "What's school in Australia like?"

I think the reason I've had a hard time answering these questions is because I think about the future in wide terms, but I live my reality in extremely small details. What this amounts to is this discrepancy between what I can visualize or understand and what's actually going on. I'm having a hard time fully articulating this, so instead, here is a list of responses that I'm inclined to give when I think about the question "What's Australia like?"

- My room card key is always at the back of my phone and my hand isn't used to the dimensions of it.
- I don't have to replace my milk as often because it comes in jugs.
- It takes me a full minute to fasten the right strap of my sandals.
- There's one light on my way to university that's always red when I get there.
- None of my classes are back to back so I never have to rush on campus.
- The bowls in my room are just slightly smaller than the ones I'm used to at home, so I never know how much food I'm eating.
- Whenever I wash my face, water always drips out of the sink onto the floor.
- I can always hear the low hum of traffic through my window in my room.
- People keep inviting me to Facebook events back home and I don't know if it's rude to decline or just practical.
- I still don't know the rules about which side of the sidewalk to walk on.
- The train station is super close to me so I don't have to take the bus.
- When I go to the beach, I get sand in literally all of my belongings.
- I can't charge my laptop and phone at the same time because I only have one good quality adapter.
- Cans here have tabs, so I don't need a can opener.

These kinds of things are things that I had never even considered while thinking about this trip, many of which I couldn't foresee even if I wanted to. But literally every single day at least six of these are running through my head, because they affect my daily life, and that's how we live - daily. AustraliaÂ *is* like the 'big picture' -- it's hot, and I've seen kangaroos, and there are lots of beaches -- but living here in Sydney is not only those things, but this assortments of hundreds of other details that have become part of my life now. Personally, I think it's pretty cool that even though you can think ahead to what our lives might look like in years or even months, there will always be things that surprise you when you get there :)
