Blogs are probably one of my favourite things about the Internet, and I spend a lot of time reading or browsing them. Generally, I like blogs that help me to think better, teach me something, or give me a glance into someone else's head. In no particular order, here are some of the blogs that I really enjoy:

## Blogs I regularly read

[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) is an investor that writes excellent articles/essays usually related to software development, investing, or work in general. A few essays to start with: [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html), [The Four Quadrants of Conformism](http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html), or [The Lesson to Unlearn](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html).

[Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/), written primarily by Venkatesh Rao, is difficult to explain (the blog itself doesn't even try) and very fun to read. [The Gervais Principle, or The Office According to "The Office"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/) is incredibly entertaining and informative; I'm also still chewing on [Make Your Own Rules](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/02/15/make-your-own-rules/).

[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), by Randall Munroe, is actually a webcomic but deserves a mention all the same &mdash; I've encountered so many life situations that match an xkcd comic perfectly. See [Exploits of a Mom](https://xkcd.com/327/), [Unreachable State](https://xkcd.com/2200/), [Too Much Talking](https://xkcd.com/2134/), and [Listen to Yourself](https://xkcd.com/481/)... then just spam the "Random" button and enjoy your life.

[Commonplace](https://commoncog.com/blog/), written by Cedric Chin, dives deep into business and career decisions and consistently produces high quality content. I love the posts focused on thinking and learning, especially the [tacit knowledge series](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/) and the categorization of [three kinds of non-fiction books](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/).

[Captain Awkward](https://captainawkward.com/), an advice blog by Jennifer Peepas, has been a favourite for years. She has a lot of great writing about boundaries, communication, and navigating tricky group dynamics; I found her [counter-intuitive friendship advice](https://captainawkward.com/2014/02/05/546-counter-intuitive-friendship-fixing-advice/) very helpful, and I love the ["it came from the search terms"](https://captainawkward.com/category/search-terms-2/) roundups too.

[visakanv](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/), by Visakan Veerasamy, is chaotic, delightful, thought-provoking, and one of my primary blog inspirations. He has a post called [talking points](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/talking-points/) which lists many of the common riffs of his blog; his [start here](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/start-here/) page also has some of his best posts.

## Blogs I occasionally read

[Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/)' author, Maria Popova, describes it as "a record of my own becoming as a person". Posts frequently synthesize books and core ideas about living, which are lovely and insightful; I'm partial to [Seneca on Grief](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/02/seneca-consolation-to-helvia/).

[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/blog/), by Shane Parrish, was recommended to me during my first year of university. It's where I first learned about [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/), which has helped shape my thinking tremendously. The blog also has a list of their [best articles](https://fs.blog/best-articles/) as a place to start.

[Afford Anything](https://affordanything.com/blog/) is a personal finance blog written by Paula Pant that has helped me a lot with my financial outlook; I'd highly recommend [this article](https://affordanything.com/the-12-essential-lessons-i-want-to-share-about-money-and-life/) as an overview of the blog philosophy.

[Praxis](https://fortelabs.co/blog/) from Forte Labs (Tiago Forte) is about knowledge management and productivity &mdash; I don't read it regularly, but I've found certain articles incredibly helpful, such as his [guide to summarizing books](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-summarizing-books/) and his [case for read-it-later apps](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps).

[Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) (previously Slate Star Codex) is a fairly famous rationalist blog written by Scott Alexander. It's an entire subculture, which I'm still getting accustomed to, but I really liked his articles [Fussell on Class](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-fussell-on-class) and [A Modest Proposal for Republicans](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-modest-proposal-for-republicans) so I'm giving it a shot.

[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) is a blog I'll flip through occasionally; it gets an honourable mention because it's given me valuable perspective on [careers](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html), [relationships](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html), and [life in general](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html).

## Blogs I think are cool

_...or, blogs written by people I think are cool. Is there a good distinction here?_

[Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) &mdash; for her excellent tutorials and her straightforward approach to blogging and sharing knowledge online.

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) &mdash; for her incredible [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden).

[Andrew Healey](https://healeycodes.com/) &mdash; for his clean design, warm demeanour, and articles that genuinely feel like you're already friends with him.

[arcana.computer](https://arcana.computer/) (Justin Duke) &mdash; for his entertaining and incisive ['books' catalog](https://arcana.computer/catalogs/books) and his distinctive spin on a personal blog.
