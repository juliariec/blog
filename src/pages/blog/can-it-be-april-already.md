I'm long overdue for a life update of some kind, but I'm going to do my best to keep this one short and sweet because I'm not really sure what to say. March is definitely the worst month of the year when you're in university: not only is the weather is both unpredictable and bad, it's also third month of the semester (when all the major work and assignments have to get done) and everyone is pretty tired of the school year.

So, that being said, the last four weeks have been a bit rough for me. There have definitely been moments (days? consecutive days?) where I've felt overwhelmed by my 'to do' list and drained due to a lack of personal time. Luckily I think I'm over the _worst_ of it, and I have a pretty supportive network of friends that remind me to breathe and that I'll be fine. A couple weeks ago my mom visited me too, which was really nice considering I haven't had the time to go home since reading week.

I think there's a certain sweet spot when it comes to a weekly routine. In my opinion, this involves scheduling in enough things regularly such that I don't have to think about what I'm going to do with that time, but having enough unscheduled time that I can be flexible about whatever special needs to happen that week. One positive thing about this month is that I feel like I'm operating within that sweet spot. The core characteristics of my weeks are all the same, but every week I'm able to mix it up just enough that I don't get too bored. I like that I can look back and see that even though the 'school' part of my life tends to blur together, I'm still able to spend time with my friends and keep up my hobbies.

The strange thing is that it can be difficult to actually recall what I've been doing this whole time. I've come to heavily rely on my Google calendar (since I'm pretty diligent about recording what I'm up to with it) to remind me of the ways my life has deviated from routine. As I was updating it the other day, it reminded me of a quote from a book I read over reading week called _Ongoingness_:

> To write a diary is to make a series of choices about what to omit, what to forget. A memorable sandwich, an unmemorable flight of stairs. A memorable bit of conversation surrounded by chatter that no one records.

This is how I feel when I write in my journal, or update my Google Calendar, or make a post on this blog; there's a certain power that comes with deciding to record one event but not another. One mistake I used to make pretty frequently was to write extremely sparse descriptions or obscure references with the expectation that because whatever had happened to me seemed so interesting or meaningful I would always remember what I was referring to. Reading through old records can get so confusing because I have no idea what memory my younger self thought that I would associate with what she wrote.

So I guess the takeaway from this reflection is that some day I'm going to reread this post, and I would have probably have forgotten that I played squash twice today, spent six hours working on a C++ assignment, and ate spaghetti for lunch... had I not recorded it here so that it will always be available for recollection. What a life.
