For the last few weeks, one of my projects has been to clean up my external hard drive. I've been copying important files onto it since high school, not in a haphazard manner per se but not with the greatest attention to detail. As a result, I know that the drive has everything I need on it -- the question is just where, and how many times. This week in particular has found me identifying extra copies of folders, revising my organizational structure, renaming documents more helpfully, and deleting the duplicates and useless files that seem to plague every corner of my drive.

In my mind, this project would take me a handful of hours at most; so far I think I've spent about three hours on it for the past four days, and I'm still not finished. At approximately every half hour interval I stare at my screen and think to myself: *If I had just stuck with the system I created in the first place, I wouldn't have to go through all of this.* It's the same thought I have when I look at all the practice problems the night before the test and think: _If I just did these problems when they were assigned, I would be a lot better off right now._ Or when I decide I want to be more fit for my trip to Australia in a month and think: *How can I make up for neglecting my physical health for four months in the span of a few weeks, half of which I need to spend on bedrest?* And the list goes on. For every challenge I find myself facing, there's a very simple solution that would have worked if I had kept up with it regularly rather than letting the problem grow.

Here's what I think it comes down to: 1) that big things are just collections of small things, and 2) that it's way easier to do a small thing than a big thing.

Renaming, sorting, deleting, and organizing seven years' worth of files? A pretty big thing. But taking the extra 5 seconds to save a photo in the correct folder, rather than in "Assorted"? A really small thing in comparison. My problem is that my mind likes the idea of tackling a big thing all at once. To me, the concept of putting aside a few hours at some point to hash out a big task is appealing if it means that I can neglect the small things in the meantime; obviously, the task grows until it's practically insurmountable and takes far longer than I had anticipated to actually finish.

So in the aftermath (mid-math?) of this hefty file organization project, I'm trying to make a commitment to be better at honouring the small things. To hold a healthy doubt in my mind that it's possible to accomplish something substantial in an afternoon, and instead to put aside some time daily to make incremental steps towards my goals. After a while, all the small things add up.
