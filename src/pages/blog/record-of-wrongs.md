Tucked into the well-known "love" passage in 1 Corinthians 13 is the idea: _"Love keeps no record of wrongs."_ This is something I have a tough time with. I like to feel like I'm being the better person when I deal with a wrong against me by 'letting it go', only to later feel vindicated when I bring it up again to win an argument or make a case. My triumph after I've thrown something back into someone's face? That's not love - it's pride and selfishness.

There's no real forgiveness when each person is keeping a record of wrongs, ready to wield it should the occasion arise. I want to practice forgiving people fully. When I say "No worries" or "It's okay", I want it to actually mean something. As with most things, saying it is easier than doing it; but saying it is a start, and I'd like to start.
