It's useful to keep a handful of running lists and update them periodically.

This practice is an application of an even more basic principle: it's easier to do many small things than one big thing. Inertia makes it difficult to start a substantial task, and the limitations of what you can remember or accomplish at any given time will impede you from doing that task well.

These are the running lists I keep:

- Books I've read and books I want to read
- Bands I've seen perform live
- Places I've travelled to and trips that I've been on
- Quotes and excerpts from books or newsletters that resonate with me
- New things I did each year (I only did this in 2015 and 2021, but I want to make it a habit)
- Funny things my roommate has said
- Ideas for blog posts
- Wardrobe pieces I'd like to acquire at some point
- Online courses that look interesting
- Names that I like
- Books I consider fundamental to the way I understand reality ("bibles")
- Recipes to try and recipes that went well
- Gift ideas for friends and family
- Movies and TV shows that people have recommended to me
- Things I'd like to do before I die
- Questions I have about the world
- and apparently, the running lists that I have going!
