Lately I've been growing increasingly frustrated with 'being online' and trying to parse through the sheer volume of useless information and lack of critical thinking that seems ubiquitous. Once in a while, though, I stumble across an idea or an article that actually adds value to my life, and I figured that I would share one of those here!

The article I'm referencing and jumping off of in this post is humbly named "[This column will change your life](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser)", and it in turn borrows terminology from [this post online](https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421). Both are quite short, but I'll be summarizing the main ideas here. The key idea is that some people are raised in a 'Guess Culture' and others in an 'Ask Culture'. In 'Guess Culture', communication relies on a foundation of shared expectations and signalling, so instead of making requests outright you have to indicate desires and read subtext. In 'Ask Culture', the understanding is that you can just ask, with the condition that the answer might be a straight 'no'. As you can imagine from simply reading these descriptions, standards of polite behaviour or manners vary depending on whether you're a Guesser or an Asker. Askers might find Guessers to be cryptic or passive and Guessers might find Askers to be demanding or presumptuous.

This concept has been helpful to me as I've been thinking through the age-old question: _"How can I get what I want?"_ Maybe I want attention, or a favour, or a listening ear. The 'Guess Culture' strategy -- which I had been primarily employing for most of my life -- dictates that I should drop hints or approach it in a roundabout fashion. For example, if I was travelling, I would merely alert my friends in the area about my trip and expect them to pick up that hint and offer to host me at their place. However, this strategy would only work on Guessers (or those who understand those expectations), because I haven't explicitly asked for anything.

The other ineffective strategy for getting what I want is just hoping for the best. I hope that someone offers me something I want, or that they invite me to an event that looks interesting, or that they mysteriously know that I'm having a bad day and ask me what's wrong. This strategy is great when it works out, but it usually doesn't. Instead, I'm left with a lack of agency when it comes to fulfilling my own desires and I'm often frustrated that no one read the signals and did what I wanted.

I've already given away my takeaway from this article in the title of the post - ask. If you want something, ask for it. Ask and ye shall receive. This is basic stuff, I know, but it's something I never actually used until I tried it out over the past few months. It's amazing how much simpler it made my life -- instead of dropping hints and trying to pick them up from other people, I could just be direct and I would often discover the answer so much more quickly! And to my surprise and joy, the answer was often 'yes', which reinforces my belief that I should have learned this long ago.

There are two kind of scary things about the 'ask' approach. The first was also already given away earlier in this post - I had to be okay with receiving 'no' as an answer. Rejection is always tough, but getting better at accepting it is definitely a good life skill. I was also afraid that people would just be so taken aback by my direct requests that they would acquiesce out of politeness, so I tried to include the "feel free to say no" caveat if I suspected they were a Guesser. In fact, I also found that asking directly and getting a 'no' back could actually strengthen my friendships; once it was established that saying 'no' was perfectly fine, both parties knew that a 'yes' was given freely and not pressured in any way.

The second scary thing is that I had to overcome my anxiety about putting myself out there and being honest about what I really wanted. When I was trading hints and dropping cues, I could not only be vague to others but to _myself_ about my intentions and desires. When I told myself to be direct, I had to actually determine what I wanted to ask for! And not only would I know what I wanted, but someone else would know too -- not a blurry idea, but the exact thing I was hoping to receive. Again, I think dealing with that brutal honesty was difficult at first but good for me in the long run.

To wrap up, I'll clarify that I included the verses from Matthew at the beginning because they're the origin for the expression "Ask and ye shall receive", which I've adopted as a kind of interpersonal motto. The meaning of those verses is completely different from the ideas I've explained here and I don't want to promote any misconceptions about that.

Hopefully this post has either inspired you to ask for what you want or at least given you a helpful mental model for analyzing social cues. As always, if you have thoughts to share, the comment section on the post is open. 'Til next time!
