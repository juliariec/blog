I’m a bit biased, but I think Toronto is a city that’s worth a visit! Although it doesn’t have as many “attractions” as London or New York City, it has an amazing diversity of good food, vibrant green space, and distinctive neighbourhoods. In my opinion, this makes Toronto a strong candidate for an enjoyable 3 or 4 day trip — it’s enough time to both see _some_ of the main attractions and to just walk, eat, and explore different parts of the city.

I wanted to share my own experiences in Toronto by creating a guide for visitors, but I also wanted to leave lots of space for personal taste and preference to shape their decisions about their trip. I’ve left off some of the classic tourist attractions simply because I think there are more enjoyable ways you could spend your time in the city. And because there are so many restaurant options in the city, I’ve included suggestions based on personal experience (denoted by italics), recommendations from friends, and my own research to help narrow down the choices.

This list has 2 structured full days, and then 4 suggestions for how you could spend your third day — so it’s designed for a 3 day trip, but you could easily extend it to 4. Without further ado, here is my choose-your-own-adventure-style, idiosyncratic itinerary for a trip to Toronto!

# Day 1: Downtown Toronto

For your first day in Toronto, I recommend exploring the downtown core of the city and seeing some of the major attractions.

### Morning

- Start at Queen subway station (or Dundas, if you want to get brunch at [The Senator](https://goo.gl/maps/jEaKvsQ2Jt4g4vms5) before embarking on a long day).
- Visit [Nathan Phillips Square](https://goo.gl/maps/pumBDaWaUbXs1FkG6) to see City Hall and take a photo with the famous Toronto sign.
- From here, I recommend that you pay a visit to the [Art Gallery of Ontario](https://ago.ca/), which has an extensive collection of Canadian art along with its temporary exhibitions. (If you’re really not into art, you could visit the Eaton Centre (a really big mall) and Yonge-Dundas Square instead.)

### Afternoon

- Once you’ve had your art (or shopping) fix, head west to Chinatown for lunch: [_Anh Dao_](https://goo.gl/maps/z3D88oNQGymbmqMq7) for Vietnamese, [_BIWON_](https://goo.gl/maps/S6QLcwurxFFDSbiWA) for Korean food, or [_Rol San_](https://goo.gl/maps/Fx2cZATk6HGXojj67) for Chinese (dim sum).
- Kensington Market is right beside Chinatown and can be fun to stroll around and window shop, or pick up a light bite — I’m not a huge fan of markets, but Andrew really likes it!

Here are two suggestions for what you could do next:

1. Continue to stroll around the area — visit Graffiti Alley, explore some of the shops on Queen between University and Bathurst, or check out Trinity Bellwoods Park.
2. Take the 510 streetcar to the Harbourfront and go to [Ripley’s Aquarium](https://www.ripleyaquariums.com/canada/), the [CN Tower](https://www.cntower.ca/), or [Steamwhistle Brewery](https://steamwhistle.ca/).

### Evening

- For dinner in the Old Toronto or Fashion District area: you could go for: [_La Carnita_](https://goo.gl/maps/7ZsPytL5B9An4KMDA)\* for Mexican, [_Khao San Road_](https://goo.gl/maps/z9x8M389ohvEccfQA) for Thai, [Loose Moose](https://goo.gl/maps/fPN6WMEWa2k5oTje7) for “Canadian”, or [PLANTA Queen](https://goo.gl/maps/cRJBhqkZWCCSjxGo6) for Asian-inspired vegan.

After dinner, you have a multitude of options for how you could spend your evening! Here are some ideas, dependent on the season and your budget/hobbies:

1. See a performance at [Roy Thomson Hall](https://roythomsonhall.mhrth.com/), like the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](https://www.tso.ca/), or get tickets to a [Mirvish](https://www.mirvish.com/) production (theatre).
2. Go to a sports game — depending on the season, tickets could be easy to get and affordable (Blue Jays) or impossible and expensive (Maple Leafs)!
3. Play arcade games and pool at the [Rec Room](https://goo.gl/maps/pEdRRYWWa33M7iQd7) — this is also a restaurant, so you could head straight here for the whole evening.
4. Go out for drinks, live music, or both! [_Drom Taberna_](https://goo.gl/maps/REhAGMbxuxnsfY4y7) is a very cool spot for live music and Eastern European cuisine, and I’ve heard good things about [Grossman’s Tavern](https://goo.gl/maps/eCqAba3mDBgKB9B18) too. There are also lots of trendy bars and nightclubs on King St West — alas, I am not the right person to give specific recommendations for those.

# Day 2: A Walk Across Bloor

Start at Bloor and Yonge — on all days other than Sunday, the Toronto Reference Library is open at 9 AM and is a cool spot to pop into (beautiful architecture)

Stop for a coffee in Yorkville, one of the upscale neighbourhoods in the city — Goldstruck or Coco Espresso Bar are suggestions — or start with brunch at Flo’s Diner

**Morning activity** : Window shop in Yorkville, dip into the University of Toronto campus via Philosopher’s Walk, or visit the ROM or the Gardiner Museum

Make a stop at BMV Books and then grab lunch at a spot west of Yonge and Spadina — recommendations:

Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria for Italian food

Kibo Sushi or Sushi on Bloor for Japanese food

Korean Village Restaurant for Korean food

Future Bistro is an affordable cafe with a nice patio

From here, options for an afternoon activity:

Idea A is to stop at Snakes and Lattes and play some board games

Idea B is to grab a snack (recommendations: walnut cakes from Hodo Kwaja, taiyaki from PAT Central, or bubble tea from your fave chain (or The Alley, if you don’t have a fave)) and head to Christie Pits or Bickford Park for some chilling and people-watching

If you want to do more walking, Idea C is to walk south through the Little Italy neighbourhood to Trinity Bellwoods Park — I like walking down Shaw Street

How to spend the evening in the west end:

Idea D: stay on Bloor — get dinner (Lalibela for Ethiopian, Little Sito for Lebanese, La Bella Managua for Nicaraguan), drinks at Civil Liberties (cocktails), Paradise Grapevine (wine), or Tallboys (beers) and see a show at Comedy Bar

Idea E: from Trinity Bellwoods (or Bloor) head to the “Ossington strip” (between Queen and Dundas), which is full of restaurants and bars — I haven’t been to many, but I liked Pho Tien Thanh (Vietnamese), La Cubana (Cuban), and Bar Poet (drinks), and there are lots of good options!

# Day 3: Back to Nature

I have 4 different suggestions for what you could spend “day 3” on, which are all parks- or nature-focused. You could definitely do more than one of these if you had the time, but these are just some ideas about how to enjoy Toronto’s natural attractions.

Since these are neighbourhoods I’m less familiar with, I’m going to provide more of a bare-bones structure from the day that you could fill out with your own research.

## Option

**What to do:** enjoy a nature walk through Evergreen Brickworks; walk through the Don Valley via the Lower Don River Trail; window shop on the Danforth; see a show at Danforth Music Hall; watch the sunset over Toronto at Riverdale Park East

**Where to eat nearby:** Cabbagetown (House on Parliament for British, Momo Ghar for Tibetan) or Greektown (Mezes for Greek, Ryus Noodle Bar for ramen, Herby for Persian, Simone's for Jamaican)

## Option B: High Park

**What to do:** explore High Park, including a visit to the zoo or the amphitheatre; walk along the Sunnyside Boardwalk; check out the Humber Bay Arch Bridge or rent a bike from Toronto Bikeshare and ride along the lake to Humber Bay Park; visit the Museum of Contemporary Art

**Where to eat nearby:** Roncesvalles (Cafe Polonez for Polish, Bawara for Indian), Bloor West Village (Flame Food+Design for Turkish, Queen’s Pasta Cafe for Italian)

## Option C: Beaches

**What to do:** spend the day at Woodbine Beach; rent a bike from [Toronto Bikeshare](https://bikesharetoronto.com/) and ride through Tommy Thompson Park; rent a kayak at Cherry Beach and kayak on Lake Ontario; window shop and eat in the Distillery District; see a performance at [Berkeley Street Theatre](https://www.canadianstage.com/plan-your-visit/venues-directions/berkeley-street-theatre)

**Where to eat nearby:** The Beaches (Delina Restaurant for Mediterranean, Breakwall for BBQ, Restaurant Tiflisi for Georgian), Distillery District (Cluny for French, Madrina Bar y Tapas for Spanish)

## Option D: Toronto Islands

**What to do:** catch the ferry (or a water taxi) and spend the day on the Toronto Islands — rent a tandem bike or quadricycle and traverse the islands; visit the Centreville Amusement park (for kids); chill on Ward’s Island Beach

**Where to eat nearby:** there are restaurants on the islands, but they might be busy or expensive — if I didn’t want to try my luck, I would probably opt to pack a picnic for this day trip!
