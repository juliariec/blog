As you can likely tell, I've decided to resume blogging. I've realized that sharing what's going on in my life and mind with the people I know is important to me, but writing long Instagram captions or posting frequently on Facebook isn't really my style, so I'm returning to my on-and-off-again hobby of composing blog posts.

Two days ago, I officially returned to my home in Toronto after finishing the first semester of my third year of undergrad. I'm going on exchange to the University of Sydney in February, so moving back felt more final than it usually does. It's also unusual because my younger sister doesn't live at home anymore, and after growing up as one of the middle children, I'm unaccustomed to being back home by myself.

I think that I've been sentimental about moving back because I won't see many of my peers until September when I return for my fourth year. One of the great privileges of attending university is getting to know and spend time with so many people that I deeply admire and constantly learn from. Even though I sound nerdy saying it, I always feel a bit sad leaving behind the afternoons dedicated to discussing ontological ambiguities of in-vitro meat or the evenings spent critiquing the power dynamics in *Love, Actually* and *Crazy Stupid Love*.

While these things make it feel a bit strange to be back, at least for now, I think what really throws me is the notion that returning means going backwards. I've been trying hard in these last few years to keep challenging myself and growing, and a substantial part of that growth comes from being away at university and everything that comes with it - the routine of being a student, a kitchen stocked the way I like it, friends to play squash with. Being back in Toronto means that I lose those things, that there's nothing to wake up for and no paprika in the spice cabinet and my gym membership doesn't work. I think that in the past I've backslid a bit because I don't know how to be my 20 year old self when I'm at home. That's something that I want to change over these next few weeks - not to take a break from trying to grow and excuse my laziness as "rest", but to develop beneficial habits like the ones I have at school.

For now, I'm happy to be back with my parents (and soon, two of my siblings) for Christmas, and definitely looking forward to the opportunities that I have to catch up with them, reconnect with close friends in Toronto, and enjoy a change of pace. I'm glad that I've had the time to think about my transition and confident that I can return without regressing. I've already bought paprika, so I'm off to a good start!
