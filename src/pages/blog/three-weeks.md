What the first three weeks of fourth year has looked like for me:

- Rereading the entire _Mortal Instruments_ series in eight days
- Making a really successful casserole, then proceeding to tell five people about it (and sending the recipe to two of them)
- Spending a full twenty minutes setting up a garden hose
- Becoming an expert on the white spruce tree
- Reorganizing luggage (hurriedly) in Pearson with Louise
- Trying popping tapioca in my bubble tea for the first time
- Reading _The Odyssey_ on a dock / on my lawn / in the comfiest chair at the library
- Playing a surprisingly competitive game of Scattergories
- Teaching Sophia how to configure FTP clients and write HTML
- Soaring down a hill on my bike
- Admiring expensive barbecue sauces in the Distillery District
- Watching and singing along to Glee music videos with my roommates
- Sitting in on a grad seminar about scientific computing
- Discovering the most efficient way to pack peanut butter cookies into Tupperware

... and going to class every once in a while, of course :)
