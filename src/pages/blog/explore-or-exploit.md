Two summers ago, I read a book calledÂ *Algorithms to Live By* that compares a dozen of the fundamental problems in computer science to problems that we face in our everyday lives. One chapter of the book brought up a problem it refers to as "explore or exploit", which I've since used many times when trying to understand my circumstances and decisions.

Explore or exploit is pretty simple to grasp - it refers to a circumstance in which you need to make a choice between something unknown (explore) and something known (exploit), like picking a restaurant for dinner. When picking food on my own, I tend towards explore; when I'm with my family, we lean heavily towards exploit (Swiss Chalet, to be exact). The benefit of exploit is that you have some degree of certainty about the outcome; the drawback, obviously, is that if you never explore you never know if there's something better out there that you could pick.

Once you learn about explore or exploit, you see it everywhere. Personally, I can detect my own patterns pretty easily. Food: explore. Library spots: exploit. Music: exploit. Friendships: explore. What I've been thinking about recently is that I think my _general_ tendency towards explore leaves me with less to rest on. About five years ago, someone asked me to give an example of a book that I've read multiple times in my life so that I could comment on how my perspective on it changed as I grew older, and I had nothing to offer - I simply wasn't in the practice of rereading books. In other terms, it's the classic trade-off between breadth and depth, and there are certainly times in my life when I've needed depth but hadn't taken the time to build it.

So my resolution now is to be more conscious of the decisions to explore or exploit that I'm making while I'm making them, because even now I can see there's a benefit to having a book I've read six times, and an album I know all the words to, and a restaurant that serves the best version of my favourite dish. In any case, what I love about concepts like these is that they give me a framework for not just questioning my routine but reimagining what it would look like if I did things a little differently.
