I just finished reading *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* by Milan Kundera, and although I don't usually record my thoughts on the books I read I wanted to share two ideas from the book that I really enjoyed thinking about.

The first idea is from the very beginning of the novel. This is the passage that articulates it best:

> We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come. ... There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, "sketch" is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the groundwork for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture. (8)

This thought echoes the reasoning behind the book's title, that life is unbearably light because everything only happens once. I remember wrestling with this thought as I was completing high school, trying to make sense of completing an experience I would never relive before realizing that's the case with everything. I have a distinct recollection of hearing a similar idea from my guidance counselor about picking a university to attend - that in the end you just have to pick one, and there will be no way to know if that was the "right" decision, or what would have happened had you chosen something else.

It was striking to read that passage because the author expresses those somewhat disconnected ideas in an image that feels coherent. I don't know if I agree with the conclusion that life is meaningless because "what happens but once might as well not have happened at all", especially since I don't think we have complete assurance that nothing happens after life. However, I do think that this idea explains my tension when I make big decisions - that underlying knowledge that there are no second tries.

The second idea is buried in the book in a section called "A Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words", wherein the author details a series of words or concepts that one of the main characters (Sabina) and her lover (Franz) understand differently. This section was one of my favourite parts of the novel, and this particular concept, "living in truth", resonated with me.

> What does it mean to live in truth? For Sabina, living in truth, lying neither to ourselves nor to others, was possible only away from the public: the moment someone keeps an eye on what we do, we involuntarily make allowances for that eye, and nothing we do is truthful. Having a public, keeping a public in mind, means living in lies. ... Franz, on the other hand, was certain that the division of life into private and public spheres is the sources of all lies: a person is one thing in private and something quite different in public. For Franz, living in truth meant breaking down the barriers between the private and the public. (113)

The first reason this passage stuck with me is because reading it was another moment of simultaneously recognizing that I had *kind of* thought of this before but had never considered it in this specific way. I find it particularly relevant when I examine my own use of social media, and the ways that sharing things online can be seen as honest or dishonest. For example, I love to use Goodreads to find new books to read, track my reading goals, and record the books I've read. In one sense, it's honest because it represents what I've read; however, it certainly encourages me to read more so my progress looks more impressive (although I'm quite confident that no one actually looks at my profile), leading to "dishonest"  behaviour.

The second reason is that I think it speaks powerfully to the way that our reactions and deeds are deeply tied to our belief systems and worldviews. When Franz reveals his relationship with Sabina to his wife, he feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. In contrast, Sabina feels as if the honesty and privacy of their relationship has been destroyed and consequently leaves him.

This was one of those fascinating moments when reading this book: knowing their understandings of living in truth provides essential insight into their reactions to this turning point in their relationship. Had I simply known the facts -- Franz revealed the relationship, Sabina broke it off -- I likely would have assumed that Sabina was angry at him for not consulting her first, or that she was ashamed of their relationship, or any other multitude of scenarios. I never would have guessed that it came back to fundamental beliefs about honesty, and I can't help but wonder if *they* would have known that it came back to that. Applied to my own life: do the situations that I feel an intuitive "wrongness" (or even "badness") about stem from some belief I hold that I haven't fully expressed or examined? It's definitely something I'm more curious about now.

Connections between philosophical ideas and the characters' circumstances made *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* an intriguing style of novel. I hope that reading these passages and my thoughts around them has sparked ideas and questions in your mind! If this post interested you, I would recommend the book - its cadence and flow are distinctive enough to attract some and deter others, but the passages quoted here are fairly representative of what to expect throughout the story.

Til next time!
