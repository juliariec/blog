> Humans are amphibians -- half spirit and half animal. As spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit time. This means that while their spirit can be directed to an eternal object, their bodies, passions, and imaginations are in continual change, for to be in time, means to change. Their nearest approach to constancy, therefore, is undulation--the repeated return to a level from which they repeatedly fall back, a series of troughs and peaks.

> **C. S. Lewis,** _The Screwtape Letters_

When I was reading _The Screwtape Letters_, this description of undulation, the movement of waves, struck me as a particularly unique description of the human condition and the way we experience change.

Things change all the time, so if my life was a novel I'd call it one of the 'themes' (I'll save that idea for another blog post), but as my final year of high school comes to an end I've been thinking about it more than usual. I think what's most comforting about undulation is the idea that no matter what happens -- the highs and lows of life -- there is a consistent level that we hover around.

In the past, this idea of troughs and peaks has often been used to compare the emotional outbursts of my older sister, Emily, and I. Emily's display of emotions was described as fluctuating subtly around this consistent level, whereas my emotions are best described with the phrase "high highs and low lows". Relating this to a novel we studied earlier in the year, _Brave New World_, the novel's World State eliminates the capacity of their citizens to feel emotions. They don't want to deal with the 'lows' of grief and pain, but in the process they restrict themselves from the true 'highs' of love and joy.

Undulation, in my mind, also looks like a sinusoidal graph. Assuming it hasn't been translated, the graph fluctuates around y=0. Despite its troughs and peaks, the graph is based around this line.

I once read a quote that went along the lines of "Don't make a decision when you're angry or a promise when you're happy". It kind of makes sense -- avoid critical moments when you're at the top of a peak or the bottom of a trough. But when I went around to actually applying it to my life, it went a lot like this: "Oh, I shouldn't do this now, I'm tired and my judgment's clouded... I can't do it now, I'm feeling really benevolent and I'll feel worse later... not now either, I'm angry and I know I'll regret it...", on and on. What it really made me realize was that I'm not actually that good at identifying my own 'x intercepts', so to speak -- I can't really perceive, in my own life, when I'm at my most stable, which is a bit weird to think about. How can you know what point you're at?

I'm not sure if there's a simple answer to that question. Anyways, to finish where we started (I hope you appreciate the irony there) -- the closest thing we as humans have to constancy is the fact that we're constantly changing, up and down. What a strange and cool thought.
