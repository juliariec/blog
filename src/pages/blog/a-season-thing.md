> And indeed there will be time  
> For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,  
> Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;  
> There will be time, there will be time  
> To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;  
> There will be time to murder and create,  
> And time for all the works and days of hands  
> That lift and drop a question on your plate;  
> Time for you and time for me,  
> And time yet for a hundred indecisions,  
> And for a hundred visions and revisions,  
> Before the taking of a toast and tea.  
>   
> In the room the women come and go  
> Talking of Michelangelo.  
>   
> And indeed there will be time  
> To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”  
> Time to turn back and descend the stair,  
> With a bald spot in the middle of my hair —  
> (They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)  
> My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,  
> My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin —  
> (They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)  
> Do I dare  
> Disturb the universe?  
> In a minute there is time  
> For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
> 
> T. S. Eliot, "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"

> There is a time for everything,  
> and a season for every activity under the heavens:  
> a time to be born and a time to die,  
> a time to plant and a time to uproot,  
> a time to kill and a time to heal,  
> a time to tear down and a time to build,  
> a time to weep and a time to laugh,  
> a time to mourn and a time to dance,  
> a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,  
> a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,  
> a time to search and a time to give up,  
> a time to keep and a time to throw away,  
> a time to tear and a time to mend,  
> a time to be silent and a time to speak,  
> a time to love and a time to hate,  
> a time for war and a time for peace.  
>   
> What do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God. I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.

> You can't build a house of leaves  
> And live like it's an evergreen  
> It's just a season thing  
> It's just this thing the seasons do...  
> That's the way this wheel keeps working now

Sometimes living in Toronto feels like the Crowded House song "[Four Seasons in One Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXiIU6ZcXdQ)"; or, as the saying goes, "If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes." Last week, as my coworkers and I were complaining about the change from a balmy Sunday at 15 degrees to a Tuesday morning of -10 degrees (sans windchill), one of them mentioned that although we have these dramatic changes in the weather she's happy that she lives in a region that has seasons. I have to say I agree -- although it's temperamental and unpredictable, having such a wide range gives us snowy Christmases, rainy springs, hot summer days, and beautiful fall colours.

I've been thinking a lot about seasons now that I'm finished with school and entering into a new stage of life: working. To be honest, I loved being a student. I loved living with my friends, attending interesting lectures, making my own schedule, and most of all being in such close proximity to so many amazing people. My life felt simple, focused, and integrated. I also loved the feeling of always knowing what I should do next and having a clear roadmap of what the years in front of me would look like. I had a clear notion of what constituted success for me as a student, and to the best of my ability I lived intentionally seeking that goal for myself.

Life changes, and my life is not like that anymore. Instead of living, studying, and even grocery shopping with my friends, meeting up becomes an effort disconnected from our everyday lives. There are people that I used to see nearly every day that I haven't seen in half a year. As I start my career, I feel uncertain about what the 'right' path to take is, and I don't know how to plan for the future when so many things seem to still be in motion. There are things about my life now that I like better than what it was a year ago, but it's different from what I'm used to, and newness always comes with an adjustment period.

Over the past few months I've been thinking a lot about timing and cycles. At the beginning of the post I included two passages of poetry and one lyric excerpt, all of which are close to my heart and have provided a lot of food for thought for me. Each in their own way are a call to me: to be patient, to trust, to be discerning, and to refrain from holding on too tightly to things that weren't meant to be mine forever.

The last one is especially hard for me. I think that I hadn't fully accepted that my time as a student would end and that I would have to move on to something else, and when my season of life shifted it caught me off guard. I've been trying to keep ways of living and relating alive that were never meant to last forever, and it's been much more painful than if I had moved gracefully in the direction my life was moving too. What I especially like about these quotes is that thinking about seasons is such a natural way to conceptualize how our lives change. We understand that each season makes a way for the other, that they need each other in order to flourish, that they work in tandem and not in opposition. As Ecclesiastes says, everything is beautiful in its time. Maybe snow isn't beautiful on November 11, but come December 24 we will all be singing a different tune about it.

Right now I am resistant to being rushed. That was one thing I tried to faithfully communicate over the last few months when I was asked when I would start work -- that I wasn't in a rush, that I would start and then keep going but that it didn't need to be at that very instant. There's a fine balance between moving too quickly and moving too slowly, and that's why I say that it demands trust and discernment. Some things are pointless to race ahead to, and some things are not so scary once you've begun. I'm not professing to being an expert, but I am attempting to be attentive to the way that fear and pressure can transform what could be a fruitful period of growth into one of anxiety and sorrow. I don't want to rush ahead to the next moment -- I want to enjoy the one I'm in right now, even if it's one I'm unfamiliar with, even if I still miss what I used to have.

To conclude, another beautiful thought from "[Wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ3fT1eV6w0)", the song referenced above:

> And if you never stop when you wave goodbye  
> You just might find if you give it time  
> You will wave hello again  
> You just might wave hello again.

How can we know what will happen? How can we know which things we leave behind are gone forever and which things are only gone for a while? How can we know what has fallen away to make space for something else? What's decayed to give life to something new? Who we will see again, and who we have already seen for the last time? What we encounter that existed before, even that we've known before? As Pierre Laplace said: "What we know here is very little, but what we are ignorant of is immense."
