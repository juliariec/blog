Last week, I finished reading _[Life in Code: A Personal History of Technology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450584-life-in-code)_, a series of essays in which the author, Ellen Ullman, discusses computing and technology by reflecting on her own experience as a programmer. These essays range in topic -- some about the initial growth of the Internet, some about her personal job experiences, some about artificial intelligence, etc. -- but are connected by a measured, reflective tone and a clear writing style. This book was especially interesting to me as I think about my own potential career in computer science and the connections that this discipline has to so many areas of human life. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in computer science or technology, and I think that if you have any experience programming there will be sections where (like me) you can deeply relate to the author's experiences.

Given that brief overview of what the book is about and why I enjoyed it so much, I wanted to write this post to share some of the excerpts from the book that seemed particularly relevant or thought-provoking to me. Each section will have the title of the essay the excerpt is from (and possibly some pre-quote clarification)!

### What We Were Afraid of As We Feared Y2K

> I learned from the beginning what a hard time we programmers have in maintaining our own code, let alone understanding programs written and modified over years by untold numbers of other programmers. Programmers come and go; the core group that once understood the issues has written its code and moved on; new programmers have come, left their bit of understanding in the code, and moved on in turn. Eventually, no one individual or group knows the full range of the problem behind the program, the solutions we chose, the ones we rejected, and why.  
> Over time, the only representation of the original knowledge becomes the code itself, which by now is something we can run but not exactly understand. It has become a process, something we can operate but no longer rethink deeply. When knowledge passes into code, it changes state; like water turned to ice, it becomes a new thing, with new properties. We use it; but in a human sense we no longer know it.
>
> Ellen Ullman, page 47

This quote, situated in an essay on the Y2K problem and what computer programmers were doing and considering at the time, really struck a chord with me because of one of the classes I'm taking this semester called Intro to Software Development. In my class, there is an emphasis on documentation and developing software in a systematic, detailed way for exactly this reason -- we've developed massive software systems that energy, money, and countless other necessities rely on, but that the current programmers or software engineers that work with it don't _truly_ understand.

On a smaller scale, this is a problem I've run up against trying to maintain and improve my program society's website, because the turnover rate is so high and the level of comprehension is so low that no one for the past six years actually knows what the code does or how to change things. Programming not only involves writing code that will be comprehensible to someone else even years down the line, but trying to make sense of that code which has turned into ice, which has properties and characteristics that may be unrecognizable.

### Is Sadie the Cat a Trick?

This essay, which is part of the "artificial intelligence" section of the book and approaches the question of what it means to communicate with and relate to a non-human other, was one of my favourites. For some reason, the author's relationship with her cat and honest grappling with the question of whether or not that relationship is just a figment of her imagination really struck me. This quote is taken from the end of the essay, as Ullman watches her cat Sadie as she rips apart a rug.

> It was like those moments in your most intimate relationships when you look over and are startled to remember: that other person is not you and is not yours to define. He or she suddenly seems to be some alien whom, inexplicably, you have decided to trust. Even as the two of you lie wrapped in each other’s arms, you know that he or she can exist without you, and does just that now and again, in moments, and sometimes over longer stretches of time: sheds you. Yet you continue on, together. And that, too, I think, is an imperative of love.

> Ellen Ullman, page 140

One of the insights of this essay is that part of what it means to be conscious / sentient / intelligent (I don't know how to detangle these when they're wrapped up together in the context of AI) is to be able to recognize another, and recognize them as separate from you. I think this is a particularly relevant idea when considering our closest relationships, like lovers and family members. I've found that although I often define myself in relation to others, I have these similar moments of realizing that the people I'm close to are distinct from me; stumbling across that idea so well expressed here was a great way to finish off the essay.

### Memory and Megabytes

> I decided, once again, that I’d take almost nothing. The files were unforgiving, frozen, perfect mechanisms for recall, and I wanted to be what I was meant to be: a bad remembrance machine. I could almost feel the memories run away from me as I approached them, scattering at the touch of thought. Even long-ago ex-husbands might now be wished well. And I realized that the fact that memory changes is what allows us to tolerate something called memory in the first place. If we could not continuously reinterpret the past—could not turn experience over and over, and so interweave it with hope and unknowing—memory would be a tyranny. It would be unbearable, a torture, a bad recurring dream. Like data spinning away on a disk: forever the same, the same, the same.

> Ellen Ullman, page 149

This excerpt is from a deeply relatable essay about buying a new laptop and wondering if you should move over all your files from your old one or just start fresh. I think Ullman makes an excellent point here when she compares the memory in a hard drive, where everything is perfectly preserved for better or for worse, and our own human memories, which constantly distort and reinterpret the past. There's a Black Mirror episode called "The Entire History of You" (if you have Netflix, it should be [here](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70264856)) that investigates a similar idea, that accurately experiencing the past over and over would be torture.

In general, I find that I always admire writers who can connect everyday experiences to recognizable ideas in ways that seem novel or illuminate more about what life is truly like. This excerpt is a great example of that -- most people who own laptops would have a similar experience of deciding what to do with their files, and many people have considered the power and curse of memory, but to make a generative connection between the two takes thought and skill. I think this is ultimately my goal when I approach writing - to find a way to reach other people by noticing threads and highlighting parallels between what happens to us and how we make sense of it.

I hope that you've enjoyed thinking with me about some of the ideas that reading this book has brought to light! This post is my second shot at sharing my thoughts and reflections after finishing a book I really enjoyed -- I also wrote a post like this for _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_ by Milan Kundera, which you can read [here](https://juliariec.wordpress.com/2018/01/06/unbearable-lightness/). I would love feedback on whether or not these types of posts are interesting and worthwhile, and I always appreciate it when people reach out to me with their insights and opinions about what I've written. Til next time!
