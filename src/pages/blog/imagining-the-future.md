Now that I'm in my final year of university, one of the top questions I get from people I talk to is "What are your plans after you graduate?". It's a question I'm still not good at answering, and the subsequent blanking in my head (??? ? ? ??) is somewhat new for me. When I was in high school, I had a general outline of what I would do: graduate high school with good grades and complete an undergraduate degree at a Canadian university with a semester abroad to Australia during my third year. Once I returned from exchange, I quickly realized that I could envision the next eight months (finishing school), but that the space after that -- the rest of my life -- looked totally empty and I had no idea what it would look like.

It reminds me of the question _Where do you see yourself in five years?_. I understand its usefulness as a general guide, but this question has always seemed ridiculous to me if I consider specifics (like [the post I wrote earlier this year](https://juliariec.wordpress.com/2018/03/14/details-of-reality/)). I often find myself thinking about it in hindsight, especially when I'm in a new place with new people, because there's no possible way that Julia in high school could imagine what Julia in university would be doing -- in an abstract way, sure, but in the concrete details definitely not. On any given day, I laugh with people she wouldn't know, listen to music she would have never heard, and walk down streets she would never have seen.

With this in mind, when I try to think about the future, I get stuck. I'm falling into a trap where I'm attempting to imagine what my life _will_ be like to the level of detail that my life _is_ like, and that's just not possible; instead, I need to change my focus to the big-picture questions and work from there. In other words, I have to make decisions based on my goals and convictions while trusting that the details will come along the way.

One encouraging reminder I have for myself is that life is often better than I could imagine. My mind is limited by what I know and what I've experienced, but reality is more interesting than what my own brain could create. So even though trying to imagine what my life will look like, specifically, five years down the road seems pointless, I have some faith that it will work itself out in exciting and unexpected ways. For now, I can make a high-level plan for the future while enjoying the minutiae of the present.

To my faithful readers and supporters this year, thank you -- may you be blessed in 2019!
