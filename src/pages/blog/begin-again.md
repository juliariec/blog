So... the last week and a half have been pretty packed! Since I last posted I've flown to Sydney, moved into my accommodation, met a lot of other exchange students, and as of today completed Orientation Week (or OWeek). Monday is the first day of classes, so I have the weekend to keep being carefree and then school officially begins!

Starting at a new university has been an interesting experience, because everything isÂ *generally* the same, but different enough to surprise or throw me. Overall, it's been easier than my first time at uni because I already have the gist of everything (how to live in a residence, how to find my classes, how to navigate online portals), but it's tricky because I've assumed certain things are done the same way and been confused when that's not the case. I'm glad that some aspects of my life are different here, like my apartment style or the size of the university, but that I've still been able to manage using what I've learned in the last two years. It's definitely given me a strange, pseudo-deja-vu type experience, but it's encouraging to reflect on how I've grown since first year.

One thing so far that's been really cool about being on exchange is meeting so many other exchange students. There seem to be a lot of North Americans at my accommodation, but I've also met students from all over Europe and East Asia! I'm also amazed that nearly everyone I meet is studying something different, and people are at all different stages of the student experience; plus, everyone loves to compare their schools and countries back home, so I've already learned lots from hearing their stories. I've also entered this weird state where I realize that everyone is speaking in a different accent but I don't really register it anymore, because I no longer have a default accent in mind when I speak to someone new.

Another thing I really appreciate here is the emphasis on welcoming students from other countries - the university, student union, residences, and clubs all host a wide variety of events to introduce new students to the culture, events, and food in Australia. Combined with the fact that the school is comprised of so many commuters, it definitely lends to a totally different vibe than I'm used to.

Looking forward, I'm still a little overwhelmed by all the different paths that my exchange experience can take. Apart from my schoolwork, I'll have so much time that I can use to do whatever I want -- go to national parks, work out more, hang out at the beach, get a part time job, attends talks and lectures across the city, learn to speak French, join a dozen clubs... there are so many options! I'm trying to take to heart the advice that my home university gave me to set some concrete goals so that I know what to prioritize while I'm here. My inclination has always been to go wide rather than deep, and it's something that I'm consciously trying to work on, so hopefully this will be a chance to keep improving on that front!

That's all I have to say for now - thanks for reading, I hope this is of some interest to you, and I'll post in the next couple of weeks!
