_Currently listening to "[Surrounded by Heads and Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGGUy_CzZn8)" by the 1975 - one of my favourites off their new album._

I've wanted to write a blog post for the last five weeks, but every time I started to write it the post would veer off course or wander aimlessly. So it's not for lack of trying that I've been a bit inactive, but now that school is nearly finishedÂ  I do feel like I have a bit more time to sit and reflect.

About a month ago, my small group from church was discussing gratefulness in the context of Philippians 4 (Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice). As we shared the things in our lives that we're thankful for and brainstormed ways to integrate an attitude of gratefulness in our lives, I realized how much richer my life feels now that I take more time to notice and appreciate the good things in it. Since starting fourth year it's hit me that my time as a student will soon be over, and that rather than just trying to get through the year I should be thankful for the privileges of student life before they're gone. This realization has turned everyday activities like walking to school and chopping vegetables into times of reflection and peace, which has a substantial effect on how I perceive my own life.

Last night, a friend of mine sent me a website called [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/), and as I was reading through some articles there was a quote that connects really well to the ideas I'm trying to articulate here. The following quote was written by a Roman philosopher, Seneca, in a letter to his grieving mother (article [here](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/02/seneca-consolation-to-helvia/)):

> No man has been shattered by the blows of Fortune unless he was first deceived by her favours. Those who loved her gifts as if they were their own for ever, who wanted to be admired on account of them, are laid low and grieve when the false and transient pleasures desert their vain and childish minds, ignorant of every stable pleasure. But the man who is not puffed up in good times does not collapse either when they change. His fortitude is already tested and he maintains a mind unconquered in the face of either condition: for in the midst of prosperity he has tried his own strength against adversity.
> 
> Seneca

Taking things for granted is a surefire way to set myself up for unhappiness if I ever lose them; instead, I should acknowledge myself as fortunate when I have them. Even though this seems simple, breaking a negative mindset has been challenging for me, and it's still a process I'm undergoing. One way I've been trying to implement this is by expressing sincere gratitude to other people -- it helps me to notice their contributions to my life and hopefully promotes that attitude of gratefulness to others.

So while I certainly have challenges and frustrations, I also have an abundance of things to praise God for. My life at uni is full to the brim with thought-provoking conversations, squash games, new recipes, extra lectures, peaceful mornings, Subway runs, interesting trees, loyal friends, ice cream hangouts, shared meals, starry skies, and opportunities to grow -- when I look at it like that, being grateful is the natural course of action.
