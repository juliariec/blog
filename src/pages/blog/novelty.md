For the last ten years, Sydney has hosted a light festival called Vivid, where light installations are set up around the city/harbour and special events are held. (Readers from Toronto (or other cities) could liken it to an extended Nuit Blanche with a focus on light.) Last weekend, my friends and I went to see fireworks at Vivid and then wander around Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, and the Botanic Gardens to admire the many displays. As we were looking at one particular display -- multicoloured lights resembling glowing crystals scattered throughout the plants -- my friend turned to me and remarked that humans are easy to entertain.

I've been thinking about that recently. I suppose that people are easy to entertain in the sense that it only takes something simple like coloured lights or a beautiful view to bring them into the city and entrance them. In another sense, though, our attention spans are short. There seems to be a constant churning of trendy foods, interesting exhibits, or upcoming artists as we collectively flit from one novelty to the next. All too frequently, my Facebook feed features the irritating phenomenon of yet another BlogTO post with the exact same caption: "Toronto just got a new \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \[sushi burrito restaurant\] \[Game-Of-Thrones themed bar\] \[activated charcoal ice cream truck\]".

So far, my conclusion on this matter is that theÂ *principles* underlying what interests us are easy to generate - like beautiful things, or delicious food - but that the instantiations of those principles have to keep changing to keep our interest. I suspect that we will still be enjoying the same types of stories even decades in the future, like we enjoy stories written decades ago... but reading the same book over and over isn't generally regarded as an intensely exciting activity. (Depends who you talk to, I guess!)

I think that considering novelty can be a bit exhausting in and of itself, because it can feel like as a society we devote so much of our time and resources into creating things that will entertain us. I'm not sure if you feel the same way, but if I think about it too long it just feels fake to me -- like we've just invented these things like basketball and crepes and graffiti so that we can think of reasons to pay each other and generate goods, or something like that. I don't fully ascribe to this thought, but it tends to cross my mind when I'm in a big city where everything I admire or enjoy (or pay for!) has been created/designed by some other person.

Even writing this post is draining my capacity for generating novelty. To the reader: I am running out of ideas to (ideally) entertain you with. The point of this is: maybe we're easy to entertain and maybe we're not -- it depends on how you look at it -- but I can confirm from my experience that looking at pretty lights is enjoyable, and I doubt that will change in the near future.
