Yesterday I flew back from Cairns, Queensland after a weekend trip that I took with four of my friends to visit the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Rainforest. Something about this trip felt different from trips I've been on before, and I've been trying to put my finger on what it was for most of today - so I'm going to try to articulate my thinking here, and hopefully gain some clarity on the way. (Like the [Michael Scott quote](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/ed/68/32ed680ef2b41586cddab603e09ba616.jpg)... only in post format!)

Meeting people for the first time is always interesting because they're meeting you at your current point in time, with no reference to who you were before. It always feels strange to me because for most of my life the people who knew me had known me for years. Even though I've had the "introduction" experience when I first moved to university, I think it feels different this time around because a) there's more to catch people up on and b) it's expedited by the shorter time frame and the intensity of living and travelling together rather than just being classmates.

I'm musing on this now because this weekend was a trip with close friends that already know me, but we still had a lot of conversations about our life experiences so far. On top of that, we traveled to a place that I've already been before, but so long ago and with memories so scattered and hazy that I almost can't believe that it's something I've already experienced, because it kind of feels like it didn't happen to me; and in a way, it didn't happen to me -- who I am now -- because it happened to who I was ten years ago.

Along the same vein, I often feel that high school didn't really happen to me, which is why it feels weirdly dishonest to tell my friends here about my high school experience because they don't know the version of me that it happened to. That being said, in retrospect I realize that high school was such a formative period for me that it would also be dishonest to omit it altogether. As you can probably see, it's a bit of a dilemma for me.

This trip, and even just telling stories to my friends, has also really reminded me what I was like as a child. It's a little bittersweet to look back at the peculiar things I was really interested in, like red-tailed hawks and Morse code and fantasy novels, and then to think about what interests me now, like organizing my Google calendar and reading books about behavioral economics. It's weird for me to say things like "I don't really like animals" out loud and remember a time when I was so obsessed with *Animorphs* that I spent recesses reenacting it with my childhood best friends.

These are definitely not the only ideas swimming around my head from this trip, but I think they're two of the main reasons why I feel like I'm in a strange headspace right now. I don't know how to deal with the first one quite yet, but my consolation regarding my childhood self is that I think I've retained my sense of wonder and excitement (or at least some of it), just redirected it to new things as I've grown up. There are also a handful of qualities that I've kept throughout my life and that I doubt will dissolve in the near future, so I can have at least a modicum of faith in the consistency of my personality.

In other unrelated news, I've successfully reached my personal goal of reading 20 books this year! If you're interested in my brief, cryptic reviews of what I've been reading, you should check out my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20764973-julia) - I also recently added my "currently reading" list as a sidebar widget on my blog, which excited me far more than it should have (see what I mean?!). Since I'm making good progress, I'm going to attempt to double my goal and finish 40 books by the end of 2018. It's been mostly comprised of novels so I'm planning to switch gears into non-fiction for a while, or at least until a copy of the novel I've been waiting on for ages, *[Pachinko](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29983711-pachinko)* by Min Jin Lee, finally becomes available.

Finally, I'll end with a song recommendation: "[Saw You in a Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxZDxF0MyV0)" by The Japanese House is a fantastic ambient listen and the audio sponsor of this post! If you have any thoughts on my musings, I would love to hear from you via message or comment. Til next time~
