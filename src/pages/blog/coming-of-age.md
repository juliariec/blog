**coming of age: ** a young person's transition from childhood to adulthood There's a quote from one of Lemony Snicket's books that says "If we wait until we’re ready, we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives." I feel like coming of age, or whatever teenager-hood (?) is, basically adheres to this quote. _Am I ready for \_\_\_\_\_?_ The answer doesn't really matter, because you're going to have to deal with it anyways.

Sometimes it's helpful, sometimes it's painful, and most of the time it's both. I think there are some things that you just need to dive into and work out from there, but at other times I feel like I'm rushed, and I can't tell if it's my own problem or something that a lot of other people my age are also experiencing.

I'm enjoying watching television and reading books about teenagers because they nearly always tackle some part of the process that is coming of age. I suppose they've always been like that, but now that I'm looking for it and actually thinking about it I appreciate it more. The characters succeed and fail at certain rites of passage (formal and informal), but observing their struggle along the way is what makes the works interesting.

Having applied (at least partially) to universities feels like a fairly major step in my journey towards adulthood. I consider it to be, so far, a successful rite of passage completed. My failure in learning how to drive is one rite of passage that I haven't yet passed. As far as driving goes, I think the Snicket quote is applicable. I've been waiting until I'm ready... but when will I be ready? At some point it becomes impractical.

For one of the independent study units I need to complete this year, I'm going to write a collection of poetry about my high school experience. I think it will be an interesting way for me to approach the "coming of age" angle of art myself, and it'll be personal too. Maybe I'll learn some cool things about myself ^.^

To conclude this somewhat scattered reflection on the coming of age topic, here are four of my favourite "growing up" songs (and probably my all time favourite songs as well, actually), plus a One Direction song because One Direction (that kind of discusses coming of age so I can legitimately list it here):
