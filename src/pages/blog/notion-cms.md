The eagerly anticipated day has finally arrived: the Notion API was released this week. 

## Why the anticipation?

I've been using Notion to write my blog posts, but the process of exporting the post as a Markdown file, copying it to my blog folder, and rebuilding the blog seemed tedious to me. 

Enter the Notion API. I can now change the status of my blog post to "Publish" and [a Node script that I've just written](https://github.com/juliariec/notion-gatsby) will export the post in Markdown, save the file in my blog directory, and push the changes to GitHub, effectively deploying the post without any further action on my part. 

## Does this mean I'll post more?

It certainly should. 

Let's see.
