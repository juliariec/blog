When I read the first half of *Thinking, Fast and Slow* over a year ago, one of the main ideas that I picked up was the concept of regression to the mean, or mean reversion. (Note: I will take some creative liberties with this statistical concept in this post!) If I think about this idea, it seems self-evident -- that on average, things are average, and when data points are extreme it's likely that they will balance out shortly.

My last four weekends have been pretty jam-packed - I went to surf camp near Wollongong, traveled with my friends for nine days in New Zealand, and went on a retreat in northern Sydney. These experiences have been pretty incredible, but it's always a bit hard to return from these social, exciting times and then just... sit in class by myself. Debug my Python code for hours. Eat more chili. It feels like it's been a hot-and-cold month in the sense that I've had stretches of being constantly surrounded by people, exercising lots, and enjoying the outdoors, and then stretches of being on my computer or at my desk for hours, doing everything on my own, always trying to catch up or get ahead.

It's easy for me to feel sad or exhausted in these low points of the week (especially since I've been feeling a bit under the weather), which is why considering regression to the mean is a good reminder for me. Spending time on my own, solving problems, cooking and cleaning - these are all things that I usually enjoy! The rhythm of student life is my average. So while they seem less than glamorous in comparison to surfing at the beach or trekking through the bush, it's just because they happen to be normal data points surrounded by extremely high data points. Statistically speaking, it's unrealistic to expect every day to be above average :)

That was a thought that's been on my mind that I wanted to share. Now, in a bit of an abrupt turn, I'm keen to share a bit about my New Zealand trip! I left on March 31 and flew back on April 9, travelling in the South Island with 6 friends for the first half and then in North Island with 5 friends for the second half! (Between Queenstown and Auckland we lost two and picked up one ^.^) Below are some photos from my trip - I restricted myself to posting one from each day, and you should be able to view captions with some information about what's happening in the photo!

The trip was pretty amazing given that everywhere we went was beautiful, we always had lots to do, and I was in good company! It was a neat experience to plan and execute a week-long trip with my friends, which is something I've never done before and feel like I learned a lot from. Also, *Lord of the Rings* is important to me because my family and elementary and high school friends all love it along with me, so seeing some of the places it was filmed was special for me too. At some points in the trip I actually felt like I was in a different world.

So: it's Monday night and it feels like I'm finally resuming my standard pattern of life now that all my weekend adventures have come to a close (for now). Tomorrow is the study abroad fair, so I'm pretty excited to meet students here interested in exchange and talk with them about the experience! Plus, I'm not gonna lie, I'm really looking forward to buckling down and churning out some of my homework and assignments while I have the time and motivation during the week. Expect another post sooner than later, and one that's a little more cohesive than this one - til then, see ya!
