It feels like a long time since my last post because I've had so much schoolwork to do lately, but I'm back with some more updates and contemplations! So, the updates first, and then on to some of my thoughts on independence and interdependence :)

These last two weeks have been pretty packed because quizzes and assignments have definitely picked up and my friends and I have started planning the trips around Australia that we want to go on before we all fly out in July. On top of that, I realized last week that I've hit the halfway mark of my travels, so I've been trying to figure out when I can do all the things I still want to explore and see here. I honestly feel pretty drained from what feels like a fast paced lifestyle for an extended stretch of time, so even having the time to write this post and collect my thoughts is really good for me.

Now that I've given a brief update, I want to ruminate a bit on a topic that's been on my mind since the beginning of my exchange - independence. Last week, Annecy, Emily, and I went to see an acrobatic performance called "Driftwood" at the Opera House, and on top of being incredibly impressive it felt very engaging because it was about human connection and the ways we depend on each other. I thought it was amazing that a show with no words could communicate playfulness and trust so distinctly, and that it was centred on a topic that has been on my mind for a while.

Exchange is often touted as a great way to become more independent, and while I wholeheartedly agree that the experience demands responsibility and maturity from you I was struck by how much help and support I received from other people to make my experience possible. Everyone from previous exchange students, university staff, my close friends and family, student mentors, friends of friends... the long, varied list goes on. Although I've learned that I'm actually capable of doing things I didn't think I could do, I've also learned that there are endless incidences where I need to rely on the support of others.

Another example of this is a few days ago when I woke up completely exhausted, homesick, and anxious. Often in circumstances like that, I try to deal with it on my own because I'm scared of rejection or dismissal if I talk about it to someone I'm close to. Even though I know that they would want to support me, I can't internalize that idea deeply enough to counteract my fear that no one cares about my distress. That day, though, I tried to be brave and actually bring it up to one of my friends, and it helped me so much just to talk to someone about it and let someone care about me.

The point of this example is that I hear so much about how important it is to be independent and to rely on yourself, and while I do think it's valuable I also think that this overemphasis can transform into something more harmful - the idea that it's wrong to need other people or rely on them as well. Honestly, sometimes needing other people sucks, and it might even be terrifying to want support for fear of being let down. The good thing is that so many things open up when we ask for, accept, and offer help. I like the idea of being able to do everything on my own, but it's definitely not possible, and clinging to that idea would have deprived me of so many of the opportunities and friendships that have made me happy.

I'm grateful for the ways that my experiences have taught me both the value of being independent and the value of seeking and accepting help when I need it, and even more grateful for all the people that I know that have supported me. It's important to me to keep trying to grow in wisdom of when to rely on myself and when to rely on others. As they say, time is the best teacher! (Even if it kills all its students... and on that note, I might go study :P)
