Last month, I turned 25. To mark the occasion, here are 25 lessons/principles that I've learned so far:

1.  Every gift requires a "thank you".
1.  Whenever you loan something, assume you'll never get it back.
1.  Arrive on time.
1.  Start your emails with what you're asking for. It saves your recipient time and helps you clarify what it is that you want.
1.  Never ruin an apology with an excuse.
1.  [To learn math, you have to actually do math](https://juliariec.wordpress.com/2019/01/08/on-learning/).

1.  Pay people back promptly.
1.  You don't need to own 30 different lipsticks.
1.  Whenever you want to bury yourself in your bed and hide from the world, go for a walk.
1.  Celebrate small wins. Consistency almost always beats intensity.
1.  Avoid [revenge bedtime procrastination](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/revenge-bedtime-procrastination/). Go to sleep â€” if you still want to do it in the morning, you can.
1.  Handwritten cards are almost always appreciated. (Especially when they're legible.)
1.  Avoiding scary things tends to make them scarier.
1.  Money is what you trade your life energy for, so use it wisely.
1.  [The best password is a really long one](https://xkcd.com/936/).

1.  Losing graciously is a valuable skill to master.
1.  You rarely need to purchase a book new.
1.  Before you sign up for any account, search for referral codes online. Better yet, ask your friends.
1.  Nothing is guaranteed. Be thankful for what you have.
1.  It's unlikely that something bad will happen if you order a dish without knowing what it is.
1.  There are few shortcuts for most things worth doing.
1.  Be kind to yourself.
