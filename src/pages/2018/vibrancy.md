Warm greetings from Down Under! I've been in Australia (Melbourne, Victoria to be exact) for nearly two weeks now, but writing blog posts again has been harder than I anticipated. Since my time in Melbourne is coming to a close, though, I wanted to share a bit about my first impressions and experiences in Australia!

The strangest thing about being in Australia is definitely the fact that I'm practically a full day ahead of everyone that I know. I'm mentally converted my time zone into the Toronto time zone dozens of times already, and I'm sure I'll have to do it hundreds more. Other than that, I've had a sense of comfort and familiarity in Australia that I didn't have when travelling in Europe. I've been here before with my family and I've been staying with family friends, which I think accounts for a lot of it, but the configuration of urban and rural areas and abundance of natural landscapes definitely reminds me of Canada.

That being said, there have certainly been lots of new things to explore and discover since arriving. Melbourne seems like such a vibrant city to me - I spent a few days wandering around and although I really enjoyed the big attractions, I absolutely loved people-watching on the train or in the streets. One of my favourite things about cities is looking at all the different outfits, and the crowds in Melbourne did not disappoint - men in suits, women in sundresses, children in school uniforms, and everything in between! Valentine's Day was especially fun because everyone was walking around holding roses or bouquets of flowers to give to loved ones.

I also had the opportunity to spend some time at sailing, swimming, and camping in the south of Victoria! I'm used to lakes, not the ocean, so I loved being at the beach and in the water. Another thing I really enjoyed was the warm, welcoming culture of getting together, spending time outside, eating fish 'n chips, and just chatting with friends. All the Australians that I've met have been really generous and fun, and at the first beach day the teenagers explained the range of Australian slang to me, which was highly entertaining. (The rule of thumb seems to be to shorten _everything_, with a lot of -os and -ies attached. 'Gas station' becomes 'servo', 'politician' becomes 'polly', 'expensive' becomes 'exie'... I was definitely confused. **EDIT**: At my orientation session they showed us [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDb_WsAt_Z0), which just demonstrates my point :P)

One of my professors last semester used the phrase "expanding your humanity" to refer to activities or pursuits that refresh and excite us. Travelling and exploring has been cool because wandering around new cities, looking at art and cathedrals, people-watching on public transit, reading new books, and spending time outside have all felt renewing and educational. I've been feeling really grateful for this chance I have to do all of these things, and I think that I still have lots to learn and see. One of my goals over the past year has been to do more by myself and cultivate a deeper love for being alone, and even though a lot of my travel has been with family or friends, I think that this last month has been an opportunity to practice that. To my surprise I haven't even cried yet, although I've come close at a bunch of random times (as in, I almost cried watching _National Treasure_ today) so maybe I need to at some point :P

So, what's up next? By Wednesday afternoon for me and Tuesday evening for my southwestern Ontario readers, I'll be in Sydney! I'm hoping that my flight and move-in go smoothly, and then it'll be time for orientation and to return to being a student. Thanks for reading my post - I'll write again sooner rather than later ^.^
