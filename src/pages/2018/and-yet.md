> _Friendship After Love_ by Ella Wheeler Wilcox
> 
> .
> 
> After the fierce midsummer all ablaze
> 
>     Has burned itself to ashes, and expires
> 
>     In the intensity of its own fires,
> 
> There come the mellow, mild, St. Martin days
> 
> Crowned with the calm of peace, but sad with haze.
> 
>     So after Love has led us, till he tires
> 
>     Of his own throes, and torments, and desires,
> 
> Comes large-eyed friendship: with a restful gaze,
> 
> He beckons us to follow, and across
> 
>     Cool verdant vales we wander free from care.
> 
>     Is it a touch of frost lies in the air?
> 
> Why are we haunted with a sense of loss?
> 
> We do not wish the pain back, or the heat;
> 
> And yet, and yet, these days are incomplete.

This poem is one of my favourites -- a reminder of the slow, dreamy days that follow strong experiences, the pseudo-nostalgic longing that misses the intensity of the past without wanting to relive it.

  

I've spent the last week volunteering as a student leader at my university and helping facilitate orientation events for the incoming first years in my program. The days have been long and hot, full of choreographed dancing, strategic wandering, and conversations that brim with excitement and uncertainty and possibility. Talking with the new students reminds me of the fear and anxiety that I had when I started university, the tumultuous emotions and strong reactions to my classes and peers that brought me periods of both deep joy and sadness.

  

Wilcox's poem is resurfacing in my mind because entering fourth year feels so different from that experience of starting at a new university, like all the emotions that ignited nerves and anticipation have passed and that the bonfire of navigating new schools and friendships is fading into glowing coals, still hot and bright but steadier, more sure. Even though the excitement has somewhat faded for me, I want to hold onto the sense of possibility, the feeling of my world opening up rather than closing in. In some circumstances, I can't help but feel like there are so many adventures ahead of me and it's simply a matter of starting one.

  

But at least in the aftermath of all the orientation activities, which were precluded by a whirlwind summer and semester, it's hard not to feel a little mellow, a bit dazed by everything and not entirely sure what to make of the upcoming schoolyear and the time after that. So to borrow the ending of the poem I love: I definitely don't wish first year back -- especially not the heat -- and yet, and yet, these days feel incomplete.
