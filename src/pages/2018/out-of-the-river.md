Tonight is my last night in Sydney, and saying goodbye to this city, the people I've met here, and my semester on exchange in general has been bittersweet. It reminds me of my realization upon graduating high school that the experience I had could never be relived, for better or for worse. It's true for anything I encounter, but especially poignant in times of closure or big life changes.

This exchange to Australia has been an amazing few months, and while I have definitely felt sad over these last weeks my abiding feeling is one of extreme gratefulness. I find it difficult to talk about my trip without using tired expressions, but allow me this one cliche: I feel like I have learned _a lot_. Some of these things I expected, like the challenge of taking rigorous computer science classes at a new university or setting up a life in a different country, but there were so many lessons that I didn't think I'd learn that I am thankful for. More than anything, I feel that I know more about myself and how I see the world than I did before. There's something about trying to sum up all of myself -- my language and culture and family and major and values and hobbies and preferences -- or trying to discover all of those things about another person that really made me consider what those are and how they all fit together. I don't know how much I have changed, but I know for certain that my own conception of myself has shifted since I left Canada.

A few of my friends have asked me if I'm sad to leave Sydney or if I'll miss it here. I think my answers to their inquiries have been subpar because my thoughts around leaving are caught up in the Heraclitus quote at the beginning of this post. It's sad to say goodbye to the life and relationships that I've built here, but it's something that I knew would end and that I know would be impossible to recreate or return to. Stepping out of this precise 'river' means that I'll never step back into it again, but my understanding that it was never an option to stay in it makes it easier for me.

One of the signs I saw at the Bay of Martyrs on the Great Ocean Road had the following title: "You are here for one small moment in time." That realization has hit me so many times and has probably been one of my greatest takeaways from exchange. It was the feeling I got when I was swimming at the Great Barrier Reef and all of a sudden I swam past the reef and the ocean just opened up underneath me, vast and endless and blue. The feeling I got when I stood at the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere in northern New Zealand and stared at stars with friends I made less than a month beforehand. The feeling I got when I watched the sun rise over rock formations that have existed for millions of years and will exist long after any trace or memory of me is gone.

This is the feeling: I am small in the grand scheme of things, and I am thankful to be where and when and who I am.

Goodbye Australia and a time in my life that I'll never relive, forget, or lose; hello Canada and a new river ahead.
