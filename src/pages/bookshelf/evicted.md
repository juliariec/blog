## Review

This was a well-researched and empathetic dive into eviction and the complex systems of exploitation, profit, poverty, addiction, incarceration, education, employment, healthcare, law, and policy that surround it.

_There are two ways to dehumanize: the first is to strip people of all virtue; the second is to cleanse them of all sin._
