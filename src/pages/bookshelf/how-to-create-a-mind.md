review: "This book is not very cohesive, ranges pretty dramatically in technicality, and (in my opinion) has too much information about the author. That said, there's lots to learn about the brain, the proposed method of using hidden hierarchical Markov models is interesting, and the discussions on intelligence and consciousness at the end are worthwhile. Also, upon rereading I've realized it's much more understandable (and I got a lot more out of it) when I had some exposure to discrete math, machine learning, etc. prior to reading it."

## Review

This book is not very cohesive, ranges pretty dramatically in technicality, and (in my opinion) has too much information about the author. That said, there's lots to learn about the brain, the proposed method of using hidden hierarchical Markov models is interesting, and the discussions on intelligence and consciousness at the end are worthwhile. Also, upon rereading I've realized it's much more understandable (and I got a lot more out of it) when I had some exposure to discrete math, machine learning, etc. prior to reading it.
