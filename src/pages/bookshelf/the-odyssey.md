## Review

Interesting story that raises still-relevant questions about free will, personal resilience, leadership, hospitality, and relationships. I enjoyed reading about the challenges Odysseus faced on his journey home the most. Some chapters / passages were difficult to get through and I didn't feel strong emotions about many of the characters.
