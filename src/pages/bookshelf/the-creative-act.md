review: "This book felt slow to me at first, but once I started to relate what I was reading in this book to my work and my blog I found it much more insightful. Some of the remarks that particularly stood out to me: devising containers as organizing principles, working on a piece as a way to explore an idea, and letting go of work while it still resonates with your experience.

## Review

This book felt slow to me at first, but once I started to relate what I was reading in this book to my work and my blog I found it much more insightful. Some of the remarks that particularly stood out to me: devising containers as organizing principles, working on a piece as a way to explore an idea, and letting go of work while it still resonates with your experience.

_In an environment where nothing is permanent, we produce static artifacts. Mementos of spirit. We hope they'll live forever, holding resonance through each passing decade. Some might, many won't. We can only keep building. … When you and the work are in sync, there's a time to get it out and move on._
