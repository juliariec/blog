review: "I think the topic of this book, Canada's horrific treatment of Japanese Canadians during WWII, is an important period of Canadian history to learn about, and in that respect I think this novel was worth reading. It had some beautiful passages, and I especially liked the focus on silence and speech throughout the book. However, the style of this novel made it difficult for me to get through it; it demands an attention to detail and time that I couldn't sustain. "

## Review

I think the topic of this book, Canada's horrific treatment of Japanese Canadians during WWII, is an important period of Canadian history to learn about, and in that respect I think this novel was worth reading. It had some beautiful passages, and I especially liked the focus on silence and speech throughout the book. However, the style of this novel made it difficult for me to get through it; it demands an attention to detail and time that I couldn't sustain.
