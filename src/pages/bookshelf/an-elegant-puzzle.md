## Review

This book was dense with specific, actionable information. The writing assumes that the reader is familiar with a lot of its context, which makes the writing much more economical but its accessibility more limited.

I'm glad that I read this, because I enjoy building out mental scaffolding for things I want to learn in the future, but most of it isn't applicable to me (yet?). The section on leveling is immediately helpful, and something that I'm going to think about in relation to my own career.
