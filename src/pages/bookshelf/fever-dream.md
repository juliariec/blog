## Review

Definitely a disorienting read - I was a little frantic reading it, trying to figure out what was going on, which I think was intended. I didn't love it for that reason (I like knowing what's happening and getting closure), but it was a cool outlier from the novels I usually read. Makes me scared to be a parent.
