## Review

I really liked the novel's setup, but felt a bit disappointed by its conclusion. I was much more interested in Desiree and Stella than I was in Jude and Kennedy.

_This was how Desiree thought of herself then: the single dynamic force in Stella's life, a gust of wind strong enough to rip out her roots. This was the story Desiree needed to tell herself and Stella allowed her to. They both felt safe inside it._
