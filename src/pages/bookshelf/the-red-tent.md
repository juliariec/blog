## Review

The story of several chapters in Genesis from the perspective of Jacob's only daughter, Dinah, this was a fascinating idea of what the female side of the story might have looked like. What sold this book for me were the complex relational portrayals of the first half, which were varied and insightful, and the tone of the second half, which was reflective and poignant.
