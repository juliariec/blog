## Review

The best phrase to describe this novel is "way too real". Clever, prescient, an excellent read.

_What I didn't say was: I know you too well. You live your life idealistically. You think it's possible to opt out of the system. ... I used to admire this about you, how fervently you clung to your beliefs—I called it integrity—but five years of watching you live this way has changed me. In this world, money is freedom. Opting out is not a real choice._
