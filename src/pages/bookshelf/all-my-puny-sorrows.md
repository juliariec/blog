review: "I had a hard time putting this novel down. What I liked most was the heart of the story – seeing the love that Yoli and Elf have for each other, empathizing with the family's pain and each of the characters' difficult situations, and amidst the serious tone smiling or laughing at the funny moments and clever lines throughout the book. Really enjoyed it and will definitely come back to it at some point."

## Review

I had a hard time putting this novel down. What I liked most was the heart of the story – seeing the love that Yoli and Elf have for each other, empathizing with the family's pain and each of the characters' difficult situations, and amidst the serious tone smiling or laughing at the funny moments and clever lines throughout the book. Really enjoyed it and will definitely come back to it at some point.
