review: "After being halfway through this book since high school I finally read it! I really liked certain passages of the novel because of the descriptions and turns of phrase. I think I didn't enjoy it as much because I've heard about it so much/seen the movie so the novelty has worn off – would have liked it better if I didn't know what happened next or didn't have a visual to accompany my reading."

## Review

After being halfway through this book since high school I finally read it! I really liked certain passages of the novel because of the descriptions and turns of phrase. I think I didn't enjoy it as much because I've heard about it so much/seen the movie so the novelty has worn off – would have liked it better if I didn't know what happened next or didn't have a visual to accompany my reading.
