## Review

This novel oscillated between sweeping themes and minutiae. The attention to detail and setting is what makes it stand out; it also makes it challenging to read. It tells a sad story, especially its focus on desire and unfulfillment.

_But so fluid a thing was love. It wasn't firm, he was learning, it wasn't a scripture; it was a wobbliness that lent itself to betrayal, taking the mold of whatever he poured it into. And in fact, it was difficult to keep from pouring it into numerous vessels. It could be used for all kinds of purposes... He wished it were a constraint. It was truly beginning to frighten him._
