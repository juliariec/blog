review: "This novel was so engrossing, to the point where I wanted my bus ride to last longer so I could spend more time reading it. I really liked the shifts between each character's perspective – not only did it add to the unraveling of the plot but I was able to get a strong sense of their personalities and values. As always, the themes were what made it for me – I loved the focus on parenting, loyalty, responsibility/blame, and authenticity. "

## Review

This novel was so engrossing, to the point where I wanted my bus ride to last longer so I could spend more time reading it. I really liked the shifts between each character's perspective – not only did it add to the unraveling of the plot but I was able to get a strong sense of their personalities and values. As always, the themes were what made it for me – I loved the focus on parenting, loyalty, responsibility/blame, and authenticity.
