## Review

I read this book very apprehensively, especially because it has a sales-pitch/miracle-cure tone, but it actually taught me a lot about the endocrine system, the menstrual cycle, and how to regulate blood sugar. I also liked the discussion of masculine and feminine energies at the end. If you can breeze over about half of it, you might benefit from the other half.
