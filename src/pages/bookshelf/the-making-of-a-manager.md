## Review

Concise, practical, and fairly comprehensive book about how to work as an excellent manager. It was well organized and had some great advice – I've never given much thought to management, but it made me reflect on my workplace, job interviews, and even my work as a program director at camp a couple years ago. Would definitely recommend this one.

The sections I enjoyed the most: analyzing why giving feedback is essential and recommendations for how to provide it effectively; her breakdown of different types of meetings and what a successful outcome looks like for each; and strategies for hiring well and deciding between candidates.
