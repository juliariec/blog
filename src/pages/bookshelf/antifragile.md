## Review

This book was thought-provoking; I've been pleasantly surprised by how relevant the concept of antifragility has been to my own thinking. Maybe 2025 will be my year of strategic chaos…

_Time is functionally similar to volatility: the more time, the more events, the more disorder. Consider that if you can suffer limited harm and are antifragile to small errors, time brings the kind of errors or reverse errors that end up benefiting you. This is simply what your grandmother calls experience. The fragile breaks with time._
