review: "I received this book when I was in grade 10, did the quiz, received my strengths assessment, and then forgot all about it. Eight years later, rereading this book and thinking through my strengths has been really helpful! I've shared the 'strength = talent x investment' formula with a few of my friends, and I appreciated the caveat of limiting liabilities. I couldn't redo the quiz, but just reading through the book was enough to identify my top four strengths."

## Review

I received this book when I was in grade 10, did the quiz, received my strengths assessment, and then forgot all about it. Eight years later, rereading this book and thinking through my strengths has been really helpful! I've shared the "strength = talent x investment" formula with a few of my friends, and I appreciated the caveat of limiting liabilities. I couldn't redo the quiz, but just reading through the book was enough to identify my top four strengths.
