## Review

Reading this made me thankful for the rights I have as a woman in the 21st century. There were a lot of strong scenes and I think both storylines in the novel were interesting, but the connection between them was a bit underdeveloped and the execution of the novel in general fell short of what it could have been.

_He wanted to remake the world in the image of equality. He understood the ways it was unequal, but this understanding created ambition inside of him. He was so different from her father, she'd reflected as she'd gone home in the taxi, who understood the same things, but then used them to his advantage._
