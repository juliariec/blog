## Review

I saw so many people online recommending this personal finance book that I wanted to read it and understand what the hype was about. The book was just an average PF book, but Sethi's tone made him sound like a jerk and made the book unpleasant to read… which honestly surprised me, because he's so well known in PF and yet the target demographic of that book felt extremely narrow.

A few months later, I've just finished watching his Netflix series and it's much better. His approach to personal finance (habits, strategies, mindsets) is much more compelling and understandable in the show. Skip the book, watch the series.
