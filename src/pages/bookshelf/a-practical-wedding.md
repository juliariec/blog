## Review

A breath of fresh air in the otherwise intimidating and expensive wedding industry. I wish that I had read this a few months earlier than I did — I think it would have been even more helpful then.

_Because joy—full-throated, fully present, vibrating joy like you've never felt? That is what your wedding is about._
