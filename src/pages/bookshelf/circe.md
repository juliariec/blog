review: "A stellar read - I essentially couldn't put it down. It was bursting with so many different stories, yet felt focused and cohesive. I loved the beautiful prose, especially the careful characterizations of the many characters, and in particular the relationship between Circe and Hermes really struck me. Definitely cool to see some of the content of <i>The Odyssey</i> told in a similar style to <i>Cassandra</i>, considering I read them both this year."

## Review

A stellar read - I essentially couldn't put it down. It was bursting with so many different stories, yet felt focused and cohesive. I loved the beautiful prose, especially the careful characterizations of the many characters, and in particular the relationship between Circe and Hermes really struck me. Definitely cool to see some of the content of _The Odyssey_ told in a similar style to _Cassandra_, considering I read them both this year.
