## Review

I was probably three chapters from the end when I gave up on this book a few years ago and returned just so it wouldn't annoy me anymore... honestly, I just couldn't get behind this one. I enjoyed the beginning, but getting to the end felt like a chore; there were certainly funny and thought-provoking parts, but they were buried in a lot of writing that didn't interest me.
