## Review

**2nd read (Dec 17, 2022):** I finally reread this book and it’s truly a delightful assortment of tree facts. I wish that it was a bit more science-heavy, but I loved the breadth and novelty of information.

**1st read (Nov 15, 2018):** Interesting information about characteristics of trees and forest ecosystems in an accessible, colloquial style. Lack of organization in the text made it a little difficult to follow the author's trajectory.
