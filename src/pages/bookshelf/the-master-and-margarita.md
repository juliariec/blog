review: "Absurd and entertaining. I loved the Pontius Pilate narrative, appreciated the attention to the difficulty of apartment hunting in Moscow, rooted for Ivan, and did my best to keep up with the rest of the story. My takeaway here is that it's difficult to understand a 'devastating satire of Soviet life' when you know nothing about Soviet life. God bless Richard Pevear for his introduction, although it made far more sense after reading the novel than it did before. Next up... <i>A History of Russia</i> and <i>Dead Souls</i>!"

## Review

Absurd and entertaining. I loved the Pontius Pilate narrative, appreciated the attention to the difficulty of apartment hunting in Moscow, rooted for Ivan, and did my best to keep up with the rest of the story. My takeaway here is that it's difficult to understand a "devastating satire of Soviet life" when you know nothing about Soviet life. God bless Richard Pevear for his introduction, although it made far more sense after reading the novel than it did before. Next up... _A History of Russia_ and _Dead Souls_!
