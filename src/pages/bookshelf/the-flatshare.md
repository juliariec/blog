review: "Cute, light romance with an entertaining premise (they share a flat at alternating times of the day and communicate with post it notes) and sufficient subplots to carry the story along while leaving room for the main characters to fall in love. The personalities of the main characters were fun and refreshing, and I think the storyline of Tiffy and her manipulative ex Justin made the story more interesting too."

## Review

Cute, light romance with an entertaining premise (they share a flat at alternating times of the day and communicate with post it notes) and sufficient subplots to carry the story along while leaving room for the main characters to fall in love. The personalities of the main characters were fun and refreshing, and I think the storyline of Tiffy and her manipulative ex Justin made the story more interesting too.
