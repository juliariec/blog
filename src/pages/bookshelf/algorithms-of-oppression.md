review: "I liked the unique, interdisciplinary perspective of this book, which analyzes technology and information studies from a sociological perspective with some media and communications insight as well. It was academic and much more focused on library and information science than it was on computer science, which was unexpected but still illuminating. I think it made some excellent points about classification systems and the dangers of privatized control over what should be public information. "

## Review

I liked the unique, interdisciplinary perspective of this book, which analyzes technology and information studies from a sociological perspective with some media and communications insight as well. It was academic and much more focused on library and information science than it was on computer science, which was unexpected but still illuminating. I think it made some excellent points about classification systems and the dangers of privatized control over what should be public information.
