## Review

Reading this was like seeing inside the kitchen of a restaurant — fascinating and thought-provoking, but sometimes it’s harder to delight in something once you know how it’s made.

_The kind of metaphor I most delight in, however, like the ones above about fire, estranges and then instantly connects, and in doing the latter so well, hides the former. The result is a tiny shock of surprise, followed by a feeling of inevitability._
