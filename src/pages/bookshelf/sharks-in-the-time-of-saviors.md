## Review

I loved that the language of this novel crackles with the intensity that Washburn's characters experience in this story. The characters were so well crafted, and I particularly liked that as a family they recognized things in each other and themselves that no one else saw.

_The house pops and creaks and flexes around us. It's blue and dark out there. I ask Mom if love ever made her feel alone. If it ever made her feel like she was starving in a room full of food. She laughs. "Only every day."_
