review: "I liked this book more than <i>The Lowland</i>, but again I felt like the writing was too descriptive for my tastes and at times I wished the story dipped further into defining moments and spent less time on broad strokes. Nonetheless, I thought that Ashima and Gogol were great characters, and I especially liked following Gogol's story from childhood through to adulthood. I'm a big fan of two of the dominant themes in the story, the significance of names and the ties that connect family members to each other, so those parts of the book were especially interesting to me."

## Review

I liked this book more than _The Lowland_, but again I felt like the writing was too descriptive for my tastes and at times I wished the story dipped further into defining moments and spent less time on broad strokes. Nonetheless, I thought that Ashima and Gogol were great characters, and I especially liked following Gogol's story from childhood through to adulthood. I'm a big fan of two of the dominant themes in the story, the significance of names and the ties that connect family members to each other, so those parts of the book were especially interesting to me.
