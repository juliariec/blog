review: "This book is such an experience to read. As the precursor to most dystopian fiction its setting and themes are recognizable, but they somehow crackle with their own energy. I loved that the style is fragmented but manages to turn natural language into something precise that must be studied carefully - like math! I'm not bright enough to understand this novel fully but rereading it was a treat."

## Review

This book is such an experience to read. As the precursor to most dystopian fiction its setting and themes are recognizable, but they somehow crackle with their own energy. I loved that the style is fragmented but manages to turn natural language into something precise that must be studied carefully - like math! I'm not bright enough to understand this novel fully but rereading it was a treat.
