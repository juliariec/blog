## Review

Levi's account seems to describe and reflect on the horror he endured without trying to explain it. It was a sobering read and definitely worth it; he writes powerfully and directly.

"Then for the first time we became aware that our language lacks words to express this offence, the demolition of a man. In a moment, with almost prophetic intuition, the reality was revealed to us: we had reached the bottom. It is not possible to sink lower than this; no human condition is more miserable than this, nor could it conceivably be so."
