## Review 

I think this novel was too clever for me, but I blazed through it because I do love family drama and _On Beauty_ was full of it. Smith also nailed her portrayal of an aggravating liberal academic in Howard, who by the end I truly could not stand. The other thorn in my side was that for some reason the names Howard and Monty felt too similar in my brain, and I was constantly losing track of who was who… but maybe there's something there, too.
