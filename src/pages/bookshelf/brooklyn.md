## Review

A rare circumstance where I preferred the movie to the book; the serene, uneventful quality of the story works better on film. That said, having already watched the movie made the book a more pleasant read, especially regarding Tony. I liked seeing into Eilis's head with respect to her homesickness, but there was less reflection on her part than I thought there would be.

_The arrangements being made, all the bustle and talk, would be better if they were for someone else, she thought, someone like her, someone the same age and size, who maybe even looked the same as she did, as long as she, the person who was thinking now, could wake in this bed every morning and move as the day went on in these familiar streets and come home to the kitchen, to her mother and Rose._
