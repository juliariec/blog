## Review

This novel was gripping, but in the end didn’t fully deliver on its tension; I found the metaphysics slightly too confusing to try to stay on top of, and the ending disappointing. I did enjoy the mind-bending, and I suspect that I will appreciate the metaphorical aspects more after my book club discussion.

_"You know," she said, "this morning, for the first time ever, I thought that perhaps they are telling us the truth. We will finish our education and will comprehend something… incomprehensible. And then we'll tell them 'thank you.'"_
