review: "I loved reading this - the writing was engaging, amusing, and definitely realistic. I especially enjoyed Selin's thought processes, so strange and genuine to me, and the dialogue exchanges, which frequently made me laugh out loud or feel deeply uncomfortable and unsettled. The last couple chapters weren't my favourite but overall it was a great read."

## Review

I loved reading this - the writing was engaging, amusing, and definitely realistic. I especially enjoyed Selin's thought processes, so strange and genuine to me, and the dialogue exchanges, which frequently made me laugh out loud or feel deeply uncomfortable and unsettled. The last couple chapters weren't my favourite but overall it was a great read.
