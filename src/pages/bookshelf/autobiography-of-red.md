## Review

Recommended to me by a woman on Bumble BFF that I unintentionally ghosted when my phone was stolen and I lost access to my account. A bit hard to understand, but I liked the 'novel in verse', especially the creative and original metaphors.

_Geryon paused in his listening and saw the slopes of time spin backwards and stop. He was standing beside his mother at the window on a late winter afternoon. It was the hour when snow goes blue and streetlights come on and a hare may pause on the tree line as still as a word in a book. In this hour he and his mother accompanied each other. They did not turn on the light but stood quiet and watched the night come washing up towards them. Saw it arrive, touch, move past them and it was gone._
