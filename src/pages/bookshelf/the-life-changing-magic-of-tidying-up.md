## Review

I loved this book - charming and inspirational. The advice I took to heart the most: pick a place for everything to 'live' in your house; don't involve your family in the cleaning process; don't start the process with sentimental items; and only keep things that you truly love.

_Life becomes far easier once you know that things will still work out even if you are lacking something._
