review: "Tense, intriguing novel centered around the mysterious death of Nathan's younger brother Cameron. Loved the way the story gradually uncovered both Nathan's backstory and what happened to Cameron through the family's interactions following the discovery of his body. The attention to the environment really contributed to the themes of isolation/community and silence/speech throughout the novel. Was a bit slow at first but it picks up - this one is worth a read!"

## Review

Tense, intriguing novel centered around the mysterious death of Nathan's younger brother Cameron. Loved the way the story gradually uncovered both Nathan's backstory and what happened to Cameron through the family's interactions following the discovery of his body. The attention to the environment really contributed to the themes of isolation/community and silence/speech throughout the novel. Was a bit slow at first but it picks up - this one is worth a read!
