## Review

Such an interesting, useful book! It has a fairly wide scope of content, some I found more intriguing than others, but altogether incredibly relevant to understanding cognitive biases and heuristics, plus some helpful sections on decision making and probability as well. This is a book I'd recommend to so many people because I genuinely think it has already significantly improved my ability to think clearly.

Some of my favourite concepts/sections were, in no particular order: the psychological impact that losses have, how what I perceived as 'jinx' is just regression to the mean, the importance of thinking deeply about what seem like surface level questions, and the philosophical implications of the difference between the experiencing and the remembering selves.
