## Review

A murder mystery set in New Zealand during the gold rush, with an overarching astrological structure—this novel was entertaining, but I think it was too clever (and therefore far too long) to be properly fun.

_What a fine thing it would be, he thought, to be able to say that one's fortune was older than all the ages of men and history; to say that one had chanced upon it, had plucked it from the earth with one's own bare hands._
