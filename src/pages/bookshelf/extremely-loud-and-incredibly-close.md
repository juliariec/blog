review: "I read this book a while ago and decided to reread it when a friend mentioned it to me and I remembered that I had liked it. It hit me much harder than I thought it would, the stories of both Oskar and his grandfather; the intensity of the stories is intentionally over the top at points, but it still slams into you (especially the ending, geez). I also liked the emphasis on (mis)communication and the novel had some really lovely lines about that too."

## Review

I read this book a while ago and decided to reread it when a friend mentioned it to me and I remembered that I had liked it. It hit me much harder than I thought it would, the stories of both Oskar and his grandfather; the intensity of the stories is intentionally over the top at points, but it still slams into you (especially the ending, geez). I also liked the emphasis on (mis)communication and the novel had some really lovely lines about that too.
