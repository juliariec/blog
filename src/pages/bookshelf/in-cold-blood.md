review: "This book was fairly interesting – there were a few sections with too much detail, and certain elements seemed repetitive, but for the most part it provided a comprehensive and fascinating account of the Clutter killings. It felt like it focused a lot on eliciting sympathy for Perry Smith (or at least diving deeply into his history and experiences) which after a while wore on me. Overall though it was my first experience with a true crime account and I was glad I read it even though the genre is definitely not for me. "

## Review

This book was fairly interesting – there were a few sections with too much detail, and certain elements seemed repetitive, but for the most part it provided a comprehensive and fascinating account of the Clutter killings. It felt like it focused a lot on eliciting sympathy for Perry Smith (or at least diving deeply into his history and experiences) which after a while wore on me. Overall though it was my first experience with a true crime account and I was glad I read it even though the genre is definitely not for me.
