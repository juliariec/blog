## Review 

I read this for a book club; while it was great for discussion, it was not a great book. It tried to do a dozen different things and accomplished none of them; there were threads of the story that had potential but were choked out by poor writing, a lack of focus, and an unwieldy plot. Disappointing, but at least it had a fantastic opening sentence.
