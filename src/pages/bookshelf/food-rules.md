## Review

Short, helpful review of rules of thumb when it comes to eating good real food. The simplicity and repetition makes the content easy to remember and understand - I particularly liked the advice to shop the edges of the grocery store, buy snacks from the farmer's market, eat until you're 80% full, and make your own treats!
