## Review

A peaceful, slow novel with certain well-crafted passages dotted throughout it. It was enjoyable to read a book about a normal person living a rather uneventful life; I particularly liked reading about Stoner's relationship with his daughter.

_In his forty-third year William Stoner learned what others, much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another._
