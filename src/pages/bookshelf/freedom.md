## Review

I read this book at the right time — on an Amtrak ride home from a hike in the Adirondacks — but it wasn’t to my taste. I found the descriptions of his walking a bit dull, and the history felt sensationalized in a way that made me question its interpretation. I did enjoy learning some history about the American railroad network.
