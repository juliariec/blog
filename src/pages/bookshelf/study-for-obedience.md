## Review

Unsettling and perhaps a bit too opaque, but I loved the effect of the language and the slow-burning tension in the novel.

_I was a nothing, a stranger who was not wanted but who nevertheless imposed herself continually, day after day, a kind of spectral presence hovering at the edges of the life of the town, whose intentions were obscure and who for some reason evinced a terrible fidelity to the idea of staying put._
