review: "Super interesting concept – False Memory Syndrome and the chair were both great vehicles for exploring the philosophical and social facets of memory. Also, part four was suitably horrifying and actually quite distressing, which I attribute to good writing. Conceptually strong, but weak in other areas - the characters didn't feel real to me, the romance at the end wasn't developed enough, I couldn't take the antagonist seriously with a name like 'Marcus Slade', and it was too long/repetitive (maybe the point, but I wasn't into it)."

## Review

Super interesting concept – False Memory Syndrome and the chair were both great vehicles for exploring the philosophical and social facets of memory. Also, part four was suitably horrifying and actually quite distressing, which I attribute to good writing. Conceptually strong, but weak in other areas - the characters didn't feel real to me, the romance at the end wasn't developed enough, I couldn't take the antagonist seriously with a name like "Marcus Slade", and it was too long/repetitive (maybe the point, but I wasn't into it).
