## Review

Spotted it on my sister's bookshelf and decided to reread it - I have fond memories of when this novel exploded and everyone in my grade was reading it! It had way more hunting/looking for food and way less fighting than I remembered it, but I definitely enjoyed the reread. The descriptions of Panem were thorough without being tedious and Katniss is a well developed main character.
