## Review

Underwhelming, but it had some interesting parts. It wasn't cohesive at all &ndash; each chapter covered its own topic and associated philosophers, which made them very hit and miss. The most interesting sections were the discussion of Henry More's philosophies of space/aesthetics of the infinite and Edmund Burke's distinction between the sublime and the beautiful.
