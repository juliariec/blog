review: "Unfortunately, this book was not a collection of Money Diaries — it was a basic personal finance book with a few Money Diaries scattered throughout. I didn't learn very much from the content, although the section on student loans was illuminating and sad. At least Money Diaries are almost always entertaining… mostly because any form of explanation given in the context of spending money sounds like a justification."

## Review

Unfortunately, this book was not a collection of Money Diaries — it was a basic personal finance book with a few Money Diaries scattered throughout. I didn't learn very much from the content, although the section on student loans was illuminating and sad. At least Money Diaries are almost always entertaining… mostly because any form of explanation given in the context of spending money sounds like a justification.
