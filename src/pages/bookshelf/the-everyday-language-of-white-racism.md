review: "An insightful look at racism from a critical linguistic perspective, which I had never really encountered before. I think the concepts introduced near the beginning of the book, like the folk theory of racism and personalist/referentialist ideologies with respect to language, were extremely helpful to learn and that Hill did a great job of connecting the content of the following chapters back to those foundational concepts. The information covered is definitely relevant to current discussions about racist language, political correctness, and linguistic appropriation."

## Review

An insightful look at racism from a critical linguistic perspective, which I had never really encountered before. I think the concepts introduced near the beginning of the book, like the folk theory of racism and personalist/referentialist ideologies with respect to language, were extremely helpful to learn and that Hill did a great job of connecting the content of the following chapters back to those foundational concepts. The information covered is definitely relevant to current discussions about racist language, political correctness, and linguistic appropriation.
