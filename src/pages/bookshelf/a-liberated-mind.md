## Review

A comprehensive, readable account of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. It took a while to get through, but it was both informative and practical, and Hayes' tone felt clear and compassionate.

_The six pivots can be more simply summarized with this cheat sheet:_

_- See our thoughts with enough distance that we can choose what we do next, regardless of our mind's chatter._

_- Notice the story we've constructed of our selves and gain perspective about who we are._

_- Allow ourselves to feel even when the feelings are painful or create a sense of vulnerability._

_- Direct attention in an intentional way rather than by mere habit, noticing what is present here and now, inside us and out._
