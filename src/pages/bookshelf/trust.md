## Review

I enjoyed the experimentation with form, the theme of constructing self and other through storytelling, and the final section, 'Futures'; it was otherwise unconvincing.

_This defines the classical form. Music that one almost doesn't need to listen to, because its development is all implied by the form. … This music creates an unavoidable future for itself._
