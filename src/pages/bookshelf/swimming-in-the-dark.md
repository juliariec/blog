## Review

The best word I can think of to describe this novel is "enveloping" – Ludwik's experiences felt so raw and all-consuming to me.

_I sat in the hallway and tried not to cry. I wanted to cease existing. I wanted to un-be. I sat in the hallways and tried not to think of you and me. ... I tried to imagine my life in the future, in a year or so. I couldn't see anything. I couldn't see anything because anything that wasn't that moment–no, not even that–was beyond me. I started rocking my legs and feet, just to feel something. ... I went home. I would get used to it._
