review: "I would describe this as an excellent YA novel - it has interesting, compelling characters; moments of hope, grief, humour, and love; and a relevant plotline about police brutality. I found Starr's relationships with her friends from two different communities and her experience code-switching as she navigates those communities particularly insightful and interesting. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more had I been a bit younger when I read it."

## Review

I would describe this as an excellent YA novel - it has interesting, compelling characters; moments of hope, grief, humour, and love; and a relevant plotline about police brutality. I found Starr's relationships with her friends from two different communities and her experience code-switching as she navigates those communities particularly insightful and interesting. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more had I been a bit younger when I read it.
