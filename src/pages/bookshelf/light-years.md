## Review

I enjoyed the atmosphere and style of this novel, but a month later I've already lost my sense of its substance. It was an excellent choice as an eclipse road trip read, especially through upstate New York.

_There are really two kinds of life. There is, as Viri says, the one people believe you are living, and there is the other._
