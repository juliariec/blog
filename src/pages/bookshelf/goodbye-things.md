## Review

Too minimal for me, but exposed me to a helpful perspective on minimalism. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the 55 tips. My favourites:

- #8: There isn't a single item you'll regret throwing away
- #20: Let go of the idea of 'someday'
- #21: Say goodbye to who you used to be
- #24: Let go of the idea of getting your money's worth
- #31: Think of stores as your personal warehouses
- #51: If it's not a 'hell, yes!' it's a 'no'
