review: "The story was interesting, since you don't frequently learn how crimes are carried out, but there was very little else going on besides the the plot - low levels of critical reflection and shallow descriptions of the emotional and intellectual components of the story. His depiction of his life was honestly quite depressing, and I couldn't tell if that was the point or not."

## Review

The story was interesting, since you don't frequently learn how crimes are carried out, but there was very little else going on besides the the plot - low levels of critical reflection and shallow descriptions of the emotional and intellectual components of the story. His depiction of his life was honestly quite depressing, and I couldn't tell if that was the point or not.
