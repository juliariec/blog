## Review

Reading this reminded me of a quote from Kafka's ["On Parables"](http://lawlit.net/lawyerslit/parables/kafka%20on%20parables.pdf) that I've been thinking about lately:

> All these parables really set out to say merely that the incomprehensible is incomprehensible, and we know that already.

_You have done so by your own seeking in your own way, through thought, through meditation, through knowledge, through enlightenment. You have learned nothing through teachings, and so I think, O Illustrious One, that nobody finds salvation through teachings. To nobody, O Illustrious One, can you communicate in words and teachings, what happened to you in the hour of your enlightenment. ... That is why I am going on my way — not to seek another and better doctrine, for I know there is none, but to leave all doctrines and all teachers and to reach my goal alone — or die._
