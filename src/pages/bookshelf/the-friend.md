## Review

I really loved the contemplative, scattered style of this novel and the frequent references to writers and their works. The story felt like an honest portrayal of grief and coping; I don't want to give anything away, but to me the scene near the end of the novel where the narrator imagines how things could have gone differently was the saddest part of the book.
