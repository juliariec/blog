review: "This book had a great array of characters and a good setup–they are all somehow connected to a literacy centre in Scarborough–but I thought that the number of different narrators made the story a bit difficult to follow. I also had a very similar experience with this book as I did to Chariandy's <i>Brother</i>, where it felt like the stories weren't fully developed and that there was more to be said and explored."

## Review

This book had a great array of characters and a good setup–they are all somehow connected to a literacy centre in Scarborough–but I thought that the number of different narrators made the story a bit difficult to follow. I also had a very similar experience with this book as I did to Chariandy's _Brother_, where it felt like the stories weren't fully developed and that there was more to be said and explored.
