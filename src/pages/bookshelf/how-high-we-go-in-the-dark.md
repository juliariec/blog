review: "Reading this novel felt like Nagamatsu crafted a story as a symphony; the tone and timbre of the book shifted as I read, and certain themes started with one character and were then picked up and developed by those that followed, echoing throughout the narrative. Occasionally the prose was too fanciful and some themes too heavy-handed, but overall I thought it was well-crafted and well-written. It certainly left an impression on me."

## Review

Reading this novel felt like Nagamatsu crafted a story as a symphony; the tone and timbre of the book shifted as I read, and certain themes started with one character and were then picked up and developed by those that followed, echoing throughout the narrative. Occasionally the prose was too fanciful and some themes too heavy-handed, but overall I thought it was well-crafted and well-written. It certainly left an impression on me.
