review: "I found this to be a fairly helpful introduction to some of the core principles of effective altruism: that it's possible to 'do more good' with resources by directing them to certain organizations or causes and that it's worthwhile to research what those organizations or causes are. I appreciated the narrow focus of the book (primarily global health interventions), and was particularly struck by the section about what it means to be wealthy and the potential impact of my donations. Since I'm predisposed to agreeing with the author, I'll probably have to reread this at some point with a more critical eye to his arguments' premises, conclusions, and implications."

## Review

I found this to be a fairly helpful introduction to some of the core principles of effective altruism: that it's possible to "do more good" with resources by directing them to certain organizations or causes and that it's worthwhile to research what those organizations or causes are. I appreciated the narrow focus of the book (primarily global health interventions), and was particularly struck by the section about what it means to be wealthy and the potential impact of my donations. Since I'm predisposed to agreeing with the author, I'll probably have to reread this at some point with a more critical eye to his arguments' premises, conclusions, and implications.
