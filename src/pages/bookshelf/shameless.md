## Review

In my opinion, this book deeply lacked intellectual integrity – (willful?) Scriptural misinterpretations abound. I have a "say it with your chest" stance when it comes to Scripture - if you disagree with the Bible, that's one thing, but rearranging it to mean what you'd like is disingenuous.
