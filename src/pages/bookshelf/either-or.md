## Review

The beginning of this novel was a bit clunky and the end too abrupt, but most of it was written in the style that made me love _The Idiot_. It definitely felt heavier and sadder.

_"Shall we get out of here?" he said in a suave, euphemistic-sounding tone. I nodded. I always wanted to get out of here, and nobody ever asked._
