review: "I was obsessed with this series as a child and decided to reread the first one for kicks. It instantly reminded me of why Lianne and I loved these books – anything that combined magic, strategy, war, and sarcasm was irresistible to us. As an adult I agree with the pro-environment sentiments in the novel and disagree with the pro-cop ones, but it was enjoyable to relive and I was impressed how many plot points or lines came back to me immediately!"

## Review

I was obsessed with this series as a child and decided to reread the first one for kicks. It instantly reminded me of why Lianne and I loved these books – anything that combined magic, strategy, war, and sarcasm was irresistible to us. As an adult I agree with the pro-environment sentiments in the novel and disagree with the pro-cop ones, but it was enjoyable to relive and I was impressed how many plot points or lines came back to me immediately!
