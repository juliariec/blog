## Review

It's a novel about a woman taking sleeping pills for an entire year — unsurprisingly, it felt like it just dragged on and nothing happened. That was probably the point, but it doesn't make for a very fun read, and seemed like it made for an even less fun year.

_It started off very innocently: I was plagued with misery, anxiety, a wish to escape the prison of my mind and body. Dr. Tuttle confirmed that this was nothing unusual._
