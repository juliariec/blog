## Review

_The Trial_ is a book that you know before you read it; and therefore, in my opinion, is a book that needs to exist but not necessarily to be read.

_'You are Josef K.,' said the priest, raising one hand from the pulpit in a vague gesture. 'Yes,' said K., thinking how freely he used to say his name in the past. For some time now it had become a burden to him, and now people he had not met before knew his name; how good it was to introduce himself first and only then to be known._
