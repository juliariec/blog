review: "I enjoyed reading about the core concept of transactional analysis: the Parent/Adult/Child breakdown, which Harris explained well with examples of interactions between the different combinations. I also liked his emphasis on agency and thoughtfulness over tradition and pure emotion. Unfortunately, the rest of the book was so outdated and confusing that I couldn't enjoy the experience overall, especially since it was <i>long</i> due to all the extraneous information."

## Review

I enjoyed reading about the core concept of transactional analysis: the Parent/Adult/Child breakdown, which Harris explained well with examples of interactions between the different combinations. I also liked his emphasis on agency and thoughtfulness over tradition and pure emotion. Unfortunately, the rest of the book was so outdated and confusing that I couldn't enjoy the experience overall, especially since it was _long_ due to all the extraneous information.
