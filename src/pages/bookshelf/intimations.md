## Review

I liked 'Something to Do' and 'Contempt as a Virus', but otherwise the collection didn't particularly stand out to me.

_Watching this manic desire to make or grow or do 'something,' that now seems to be consuming everybody, I do feel comforted to discover I’m not the only person on this earth who has no idea what life is for, nor what is to be done with all this time aside from filling it._
