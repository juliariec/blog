## Review

I love the thematic richness of this novel (creation, determinism, ambition, morality, friendship, identity, etc) and it has been fascinating to study it in two separate literature classes with distinctly different approaches/focuses. At times it seemed a bit melodramatic, but for me it was overshadowed by deep empathy for both Victor and the Creature.
