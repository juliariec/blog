## Review

Some useful tips/things to think about, buried under unnecessary profanity, lengthy anecdotes, an irresponsible section misrepresenting sexual assault, inconsistent tone, and poor signposting. I can barely remember his points and I read it _yesterday_ because I was too busy filtering out the irrelevant parts... it would have been better as a well structured blog post.
