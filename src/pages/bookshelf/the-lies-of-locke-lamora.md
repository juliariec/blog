## Review

One of the reviews on the back of this book describes it as 'swashbuckling', which is an excellent adjective for this story. It wasn't my usual genre (and was occasionally too crude or gruesome for my tastes), but I enjoyed being immersed in a new world and following Lamora's schemes and adventures. A fun summer read.
