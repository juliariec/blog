review: "To summarize my thoughts on this book: I liked the style, but the plot was something else. I felt like I was beside Ren throughout the entire novel because of the specificity of the mundane details of his life, which was entertaining. As for the mystery itself, though, the first 3/4ths of the book pass with very little indication of what will happen next, and then the last quarter hit me with half a dozen revelations, in quick succession, with minimal explanation, before the book ended. Even though I enjoyed most of the novel, the resolutions out of left field annoyed me."

## Review

To summarize my thoughts on this book: I liked the style, but the plot was something else. I felt like I was beside Ren throughout the entire novel because of the specificity of the mundane details of his life, which was entertaining. As for the mystery itself, though, the first 3/4ths of the book pass with very little indication of what will happen next, and then the last quarter hit me with half a dozen revelations, in quick succession, with minimal explanation, before the book ended. Even though I enjoyed most of the novel, the resolutions out of left field annoyed me.
