## Review

I hoped this would be a fun, light read, but I didn't like it. I _did_ like elements of the middle section, when Allyson is adjusting poorly to college and trying to live up to her parents' expectations, but other than that she was an unsympathetic character, her day with Willem was just strange, and huge chunks of the ending were far too fortuitous.
