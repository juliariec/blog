## Review

This one is a little challenging for me to review. The tone, setup, and dialogue are pretty standard for romantic fiction, but it's insightful about a heavy topic <spoiler>(domestic abuse)</spoiler> in a way that makes it stand out from other novels of this genre. Nothing outstanding in terms of style or characterizations, but I liked it; in particular, there was a conversation that takes place between Lily and Ryle in the hospital at the end that really struck me and that made me happy that I read it.
