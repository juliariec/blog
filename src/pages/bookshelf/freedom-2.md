## Review

This novel felt too self-indulgent and circular for my tastes. For family drama, I preferred _On Beauty_; for a portrait of American marriage, _Crossing to Safety_.

_Where did the self-pity come from? The inordinate volume of it? By almost any standard, she led a luxurious life. She had all day every day to figure out some decent and satisfying way to live, and yet all she ever seemed to get for all her choices and all her freedom was more miserable._
