review: "For some reason this memoir didn't resonate with me the way I thought that it might. There were certain passages and ideas in the book that I was really interested in but weren't fully fleshed out, and a lot of the content was medical information I didn't understand that emotionally disconnected me from the book. That being said, it contains some thought-provoking connections on meaning, death, literature, medicine, vocation, and philosophy, so I still think it was a worthwhile read."

## Review

For some reason this memoir didn't resonate with me the way I thought that it might. There were certain passages and ideas in the book that I was really interested in but weren't fully fleshed out, and a lot of the content was medical information I didn't understand that emotionally disconnected me from the book. That being said, it contains some thought-provoking connections on meaning, death, literature, medicine, vocation, and philosophy, so I still think it was a worthwhile read.
