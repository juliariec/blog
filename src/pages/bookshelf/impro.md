## Review

I read this book after seeing it referenced on [Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/01/23/impro-by-keith-johnstone/) and I'm glad that I did. It speaks to both theatre and life, and I benefited from Johnstone's reflections on education and creativity, his explanation of how status interactions work, and the sections on 'accepting' and 'blocking'. Reading this was entertaining, educational, and eye-opening!
