## Review

Read it after watching "Burning", though in retrospect I would have enjoyed reading it prior to seeing the film. I like Murakami's voice and his unwillingness to demand a certain response from the reader, and the story really illuminates the creativity of Lee Chang Dong in extending it in the film the way he did.
