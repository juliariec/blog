review: "I liked the story well enough - it was fairly straightforward, following three families and centered around two main events (adoption and arson). However, I disliked the style and characterizations - everything was phrased simply and the characters seemed flat. Can't speak to the arson, but I would recommend <i>Lucky Boy</i> for a story about motherhood/adoption rather than this one."

## Review

I liked the story well enough - it was fairly straightforward, following three families and centered around two main events (adoption and arson). However, I disliked the style and characterizations - everything was phrased simply and the characters seemed flat. Can't speak to the arson, but I would recommend _Lucky Boy_ for a story about motherhood/adoption rather than this one.
