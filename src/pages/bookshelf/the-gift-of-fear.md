## Review

I found the first half of this book to be very valuable, especially when it focused on identifying behaviours that indicate danger or untrustworthiness. In general, I think the thesis that we should trust our intuition more is an important lesson, especially for women who habitually override their feelings in order to seem more reasonable or agreeable.

_Intuition connects us to the natural world and to our nature. Freed from the bonds of judgment, married only to perception, it carries us to predictions we will later marvel at._
