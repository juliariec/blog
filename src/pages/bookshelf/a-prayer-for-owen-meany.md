## Review

It's funny to me that I finished _A Prayer for Owen Meany_ on the same day that I mentioned to my colleague that I have a certain fondness for novels with a moral, weighty sensibility to them. I had a hard time getting into the book, but once it picked up I loved it; it was both entertaining and a beautiful reflection on faith and friendship. I was truly impressed by Irving's reincorporation of all the threads of the story in such a satisfying (and sad) ending, and while I did find all the "present day" sections in Toronto pretty boring, I'll concede that Owen Meany is hard to compete with.

_We were used to the Saturday matinees at the decrepit Gravesend movie house, inexplicably called The Idaho — after the faraway western state or the potato of that name, we never knew. The Idaho was partial to Tarzan films, and—increasingly—to biblical epics. Owen and I hated the latter: in his view, they were SACRILEGIOUS; in my opinion, they were boring. Owen was also critical of Tarzan movies._
