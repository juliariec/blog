## Review

Sadly, my original review has been lost to a poor Internet connection on the Amtrak. This book was an informative overview of the state of global health, and I appreciated the writing's clarity.

_When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems—and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better._
