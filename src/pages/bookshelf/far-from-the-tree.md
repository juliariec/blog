## Review

An engaging read, centered around family issues and identity. I liked the dialogue and the alternating perspectives between the three main characters, but I didn't like the ending... I think it was good that it was a happy ending, but everything felt too neatly packaged to be a realistic resolution to the issues in the novel.
