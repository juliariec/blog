## Review

<b>4th read (Aug 2024):</b> I read this novel again with a book club and it was really fascinating to hear the perspectives, interpretations, and questions that other readers brought to the story. As always, a delight to read and discuss.

_Names are a great mystery. I've never known whether the name is molded by the child or the child changed to fit the name._

<b>3rd read (Nov 2019):</b> This book gets better each time I read it, and I keep seeing new things about the characters. Steinbeck has a masterful, unique way of encapsulating their defining qualities with one well written sentence or idea. The book is honest and insightful regarding human nature while remaining gracious. So good!

<b>2nd read (Oct 2017):</b> One of my all time favourite books. I love the thematic intertwining with the characters' stories and experiences; it feels just right, not heavy-handed or entirely implicit. The pace and style make it entrancing and so easy to get through (even though it's a long book). Would definitely recommend.
