## Review

I liked the specificity and reflection in this novel – that it was centred around one person and one event, and that eventually everything turned back towards the centre. The plot/mystery itself wasn't especially compelling to me; rather, I was invested in Anton and wanted to see him make sense of what had happened to him.

_This moment... detached itself from all that had come before and all that would follow. It became part of him and began its journey through the rest of his life, until finally it would explode like a soap bubble, after which it might as well never have happened._
