review: "I wasn't a big fan of this book... it had far too much that I didn't like (a really irritating main character, uninteresting secondary characters, so many irrelevant descriptions, variations on the same three sentences over and over again) and not enough that I actually enjoyed (suspense of discovering what's going on, feeling it all click together). It was fine, but definitely too long for the amount of enjoyment I derived from reading it."

## Review

I wasn't a big fan of this book... it had far too much that I didn't like (a really irritating main character, uninteresting secondary characters, so many irrelevant descriptions, variations on the same three sentences over and over again) and not enough that I actually enjoyed (suspense of discovering what's going on, feeling it all click together). It was fine, but definitely too long for the amount of enjoyment I derived from reading it.
