## Review

I think this book is worth reading if only for an exposure to choice architecture and its effects on our lives. It was definitely enlightening to look at the outcomes of policies with and without nudges, and to realize the power that choice architects have over me. The content was a bit repetitive, but the book was short and interesting enough that I didn't really mind.
