## Review

I wanted to read a work of Hungarian literature before visiting Budapest, and I'm so happy that I read _Embers_. I loved Márai's writing, which it created such a distinctive atmosphere within the novel. The story held so much tension, and I felt like the ending was a really satisfying resolution of that tension, but not in the way I'd expected.

_One's life, viewed as a whole, is always the answer to the most important questions. Along the way, does it matter what one says, what words and principles one chooses to justify oneself?_
