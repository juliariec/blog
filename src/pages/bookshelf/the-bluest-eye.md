## Review

The best word I can think of for this novel is 'challenging', both emotionally and structurally. I love Morrison's writing — it's animate, arresting, and demanding, the kind that respects its readers and even pushes back at them.

_This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear, and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live._
