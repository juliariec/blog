review: "I thought this book was a really interesting look at education and learning from several lenses/perspectives. Not only was the content intriguing and relevant, but I really appreciated the style and organization of the book itself. A lot of nonfiction feels very heavy-handed in its takeaways or conclusions, as if trying to hand you one or two new facts that you can parrot at a dinner party; this book felt much more like a patient exploration of related ideas, like walking through a museum with a thoughtful history enthusiast rather than an overzealous tour guide.

## Review

I thought this book was a really interesting look at education and learning from several lenses/perspectives. Not only was the content intriguing and relevant, but I really appreciated the style and organization of the book itself. A lot of nonfiction feels very heavy-handed in its takeaways or conclusions, as if trying to hand you one or two new facts that you can parrot at a dinner party; this book felt much more like a patient exploration of related ideas, like walking through a museum with a thoughtful history enthusiast rather than an overzealous tour guide.
