## Review

I found this memoir entertaining, thought-provoking, and educational — an impressive combination! It was a fascinating look at therapy from both the perspective of the therapist and the patient and written in an engaging, personal style. It made me laugh, made me cry, and made me think — would definitely recommend.

_But part of getting to know yourself is to unknow yourself—to let go of the limiting stories you've told yourself about who you are so that you aren’t trapped by them, so you can live your life and not the story you've been telling yourself about your life._
