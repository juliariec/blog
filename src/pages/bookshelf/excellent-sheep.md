## Review

Subjectively, this book has super relevant content to me, and I found myself agreeing with many of Deresiewicz's assessments of the current educational system. The section on what college is really for was compelling, and I especially liked the critique of 'leadership' as merely climbing to the top rather than envisioning alternatives. I wish I had read it earlier in my university career, although I still derived value from it by reading it now.

Objectively, I think the book is only interesting if you fall in or near the target audience, and it didn't seem to have a strong guiding thesis, enough substantive research to back up its claims, or many suggestions on how to move forward.
