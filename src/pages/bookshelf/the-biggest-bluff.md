## Review

What an engrossing read — an unbelievable story about learning poker from a world-class player while exploring what the game reveals about human psychology and behaviour. This book illuminates not only the game of poker, but the complex interactions of skill and luck every day of our lives; definitely a recommended read!

_Here was the cruel truth: we humans too often think ourselves in firm control when we are really playing by the rules of chance._
