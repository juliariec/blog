## Review

Captivating, beautiful, wrenching prose and storyline. I adore Nunez's writing.

_I don't know who it was, but someone, maybe or maybe not Henry James, said that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who upon seeing someone else suffering think, That could happen to me, and those who think, That will never happen to me. The first kind of people help us to endure, the second kind make life hell._
