## Review

This novel, centred on the narrator and her housekeeper Emerence, was a character study that I found totally compelling. I admire how Szab贸 created a tension within the novel that kept it on a narrative path while primarily feeling like an exploration.

_If I said we were having guests, or visitors turned up unannounced, she would ask if I needed help. Usually, I declined. I didn't want it known among my circle of friends that in my own home I was a person without a name._
