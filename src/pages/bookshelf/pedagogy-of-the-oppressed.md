## Review

The book seemed very practical and grounded in the author's experiences, which makes it valuable for specific implementation but I think a little less engaging for me personally. Still worth the read, especially for the sections focusing on the dynamics of oppression and the qualities of truly liberatory politics.

_True generosity consists precisely in fighting to destroy the causes which nourish false charity. False charity constrains the fearful and subdued, the 'rejects of life,' to extend their trembling hands. True generosity lies in striving so that these hands–whether of individuals or entire peoples–need be extended less and less in supplication, so that more and more they become human hands which work and, working, transform the world._
