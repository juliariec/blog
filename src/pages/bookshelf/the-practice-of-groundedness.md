## Review

Felt like an overview of content I already knew, and nothing really stood out to me so it was a bit boring to read (especially right after reading _A Liberated Mind_). Although I understood why they were included, the descriptions of athletes and executives didn't interest me. I did appreciate the inclusion of the 'recommended reading' section at the end and will definitely check out David Whyte and Eric Fromm.

_What I am interested in is convergence. If multiple fields of scientific inquiry, the world's major wisdom traditions, and the practices of highly fulfilled peak performers all point toward the same truths, then they are probably worth paying attention to._
