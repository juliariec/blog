## Review

A highly convincing case for being responsible for your own health, and a sober look at the consequences of disregarding it. This book has definitely motivated me to assess my own habits and goals and start to make sustainable changes.

_If we were epidemiologists from Saturn and all we had to go on was articles about centenarians in publications like_ USA Today _and_ Good Housekeeping*, we might conclude that the secret to extreme longevity is the breakfast special at Denny’s, washed down with Jim Beam and a good cigar.*
