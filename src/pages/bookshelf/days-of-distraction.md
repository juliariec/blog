## Review

Slow, contemplative, enjoyable read. I'm nearly the same age as the narrator, so I found myself reflecting and musing along with her throughout the book. I especially liked reading about her relationship with her dad and her visit to China to see him – the passage about conflict, trust, and counting specifically stood out to me, and almost all their dialogue made me smile.

_It is the nature of relationships that they are impossible to fully understand from the outside, their inner workings built both from memories and habits and histories made up from the exterior world, that exist only through them and are lost when they are lost to each other. A relationship is particular in the way people are particular._
