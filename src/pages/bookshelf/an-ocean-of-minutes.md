## Review

This book felt very different from most books that I've read, and I have a strong feeling that it would make a great movie. Too descriptive for my taste and I was vindicated but disappointed in the ending. Well developed tone throughout the novel, which was a strong point.

_Marta and me always meant to get up and watch the sunrise. But there was always something else to do. And the sunrise is right here, you think. There'll always be another one._
