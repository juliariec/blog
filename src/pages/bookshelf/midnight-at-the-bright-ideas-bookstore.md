review: "I liked this book! The setting, style, and characters all contributed to a unified sense of 'unusualness', which was intriguing. Certain parts really creeped me out, especially reading it at night, so I think that was well done. I was a little disappointed with the story's resolution, and wasn't super attached to the characters either. Good for an easy read!"

## Review

I liked this book! The setting, style, and characters all contributed to a unified sense of "unusualness", which was intriguing. Certain parts really creeped me out, especially reading it at night, so I think that was well done. I was a little disappointed with the story's resolution, and wasn't super attached to the characters either. Good for an easy read!
