## Review

This novel was a fun jaunt, with a compelling titular character (Evelyn) and an underdeveloped 'main' character (Monique). I liked reading about Evelyn's calculations and schemes to make her career successful, but the main romantic storyline didn't feel as compelling as it could have been.
