## Review

Fascinating, engrossing introduction to Islam. I learned so much about Islamic history, tradition, theology, and politics from this book - Aslan did an excellent job of clearly communicating key ideas, weaving a narrative that was simple to follow, and providing context to commonly misunderstood concepts. One of the most readable works of non-fiction I've read in a very long time.
