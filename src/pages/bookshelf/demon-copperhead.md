## Review

A modern retelling of _David Copperfield_ that follows a young boy amidst the addiction crisis in Appalachia; this novel kept me engaged, taught me a lot, and demonstrated a remarkably effective use of narrative voice.

_It hit me pretty hard, how there's no kind of sad in this world that will stop it turning. People will keep on wanting what they want, and you're on your own._
