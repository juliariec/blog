review: "This was a fantastic read. Not only do I love this style of novel, following a family through generations, but the prose seemed to suit it perfectly: deliberate and thorough while remaining engaging. I'm so glad that as a reader you get a glimpse into each character's head and insight into their thoughts and desires. (I really liked Noa.) Definitely a meaningful way to learn about Korean and Japanese history and culture, and it's encouraged me to do more reading about it.<br/><br/>Especially loved these sentences in the book, speaking about pachinko: '...there could only be a few winners and a lot of losers. And yet we played on, because we had hope that we might be the lucky ones.'"

## Review

This was a fantastic read. Not only do I love this style of novel, following a family through generations, but the prose seemed to suit it perfectly: deliberate and thorough while remaining engaging. I'm so glad that as a reader you get a glimpse into each character's head and insight into their thoughts and desires. (I really liked Noa.) Definitely a meaningful way to learn about Korean and Japanese history and culture, and it's encouraged me to do more reading about it.

Especially loved these sentences in the book, speaking about pachinko: "...there could only be a few winners and a lot of losers. And yet we played on, because we had hope that we might be the lucky ones."
