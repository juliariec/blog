## Review

This was the July pick for my neighbourhood book club. I enjoyed it — it felt like a coming of age novel mixed with refreshing explorations of parenthood and female friendships. It reminded me a bit of Conversations with Friends, and like a Sally Rooney novel it included many passages about how little the women ate.

\_You wanted to know if I would throw myself in front of a bus to save you. You asked if all mothers are willing to sacrifice their lives for their children. No matter what I said, you were never satisfied with my answer, because you'd go on and ask again the following week.

What did you say? I asked.

Anouk raised her eyebrows and smiled. See, even today, you're wondering.\_
