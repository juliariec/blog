review: "This novel had a distinctive feeling to it - by the second section, I felt thoroughly convinced that the story was completely real and that I was reading about people I actually knew. Adichie artfully shaped the writing to feel natural and transparent, like the language and descriptions made everything seem clear and as if the author's hand never had to move anything. Both the story and the characters were compelling and really drew me in, plus I learned a lot about Nigerian history."

## Review

This novel had a distinctive feeling to it - by the second section, I felt thoroughly convinced that the story was completely real and that I was reading about people I actually knew. Adichie artfully shaped the writing to feel natural and transparent, like the language and descriptions made everything seem clear and as if the author's hand never had to move anything. Both the story and the characters were compelling and really drew me in, plus I learned a lot about Nigerian history.
