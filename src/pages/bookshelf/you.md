review: "So, a disclaimer on the 1 star: I gave this novel a 'did not like' because I <i>personally</i> didn't really like it, but in terms of style and writing it's quite good, especially the utilization of second person perspective.

## Review

So, a disclaimer on the 1 star: I gave this novel a "did not like" because I _personally_ didn't really like it, but in terms of style and writing it's quite good, especially the utilization of second person perspective. However, I was expecting a twist that never came (which severely disappointed me) and the book contained a lot of sexual content which I also didn't like. TLDR: some people would really enjoy this book but I just wasn't one of them.
