review: "A clear, engaging dialogue about Adler's philosophy and its applications to everyday life. I think the style suited the content and helped to structure the Philosopher's arguments better. I didn't agree with all of his points, but I think some were helpful and that considering his perspective and thinking about the questions the book raises was valuable either way."

## Review

A clear, engaging dialogue about Adler's philosophy and its applications to everyday life. I think the style suited the content and helped to structure the Philosopher's arguments better. I didn't agree with all of his points, but I think some were helpful and that considering his perspective and thinking about the questions the book raises was valuable either way.
