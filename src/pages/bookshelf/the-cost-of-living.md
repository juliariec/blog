## Review

I loved this book's reflectiveness and honesty; an exploration of personhood, relationships, constraints, and possibilities. My new mortal enemy is Jean, who insists that bikes not be parked behind trees.

_No, there were not that many women I knew who wanted to put the phantom of femininity together again. What is a phantom anyway? The phantom of femininity is an illusion, a delusion, a societal hallucination. She is a very tricky character to play and it is a role (sacrifice, endurance, cheerful suffering) that has made some women go mad. This was not a story I wanted to hear all over again. It was time to find new main characters with other talents._
