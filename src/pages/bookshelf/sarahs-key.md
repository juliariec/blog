review: "I was pretty disappointed with this one. I think that the idea behind the novel, to shed light on a horrible part of French history, is really important, and that telling it from the perspective of a young girl is particularly heartbreaking. Unfortunately, it was poorly executed – the style wasn't great, the balance between historical and modern was skewed, and what annoyed me the most: the author frequently informed the reader about how the characters were feeling but rarely provided opportunities for them to reach that conclusion themselves.

## Review

I was pretty disappointed with this one. I think that the idea behind the novel, to shed light on a horrible part of French history, is really important, and that telling it from the perspective of a young girl is particularly heartbreaking. Unfortunately, it was poorly executed – the style wasn't great, the balance between historical and modern was skewed, and what annoyed me the most: the author frequently informed the reader about how the characters were feeling but rarely provided opportunities for them to reach that conclusion themselves.
