review: "This novel made me think and feel a lot of things. What I especially loved was that it made gaming really fascinating to me in a way it’s never been before; I feel like I finally understand what makes people love video games so much. I also enjoyed the novel’s exploration of boundaries and distinctions, especially between love/friendship and play/work. I did struggle at times with the characterizations and a couple of the major plot points, but I still enjoyed the novel."

## Review 

This novel made me think and feel a lot of things. What I especially loved was that it made gaming really fascinating to me in a way it’s never been before; I feel like I finally understand what makes people love video games so much. I also enjoyed the novel’s exploration of boundaries and distinctions, especially between love/friendship and play/work. I did struggle at times with the characterizations and a couple of the major plot points, but I still enjoyed the novel.
