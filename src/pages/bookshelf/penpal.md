review: "To start, reading this book before bed was a mistake, because I read it all in one sitting and now I won't be able to fall asleep. This story really freaked me out – the plausibility of it makes it terrifying to me, plus certain details (like being in the woods at night) were too stressful for me. I liked the way the novel was arranged and the role of the narrator in developing the tone and connecting the narratives together; there were definitely some unnecessary passages and a few unresolved details, but overall it's a captivating and creepy book."

## Review

To start, reading this book before bed was a mistake, because I read it all in one sitting and now I won't be able to fall asleep. This story really freaked me out – the plausibility of it makes it terrifying to me, plus certain details (like being in the woods at night) were too stressful for me. I liked the way the novel was arranged and the role of the narrator in developing the tone and connecting the narratives together; there were definitely some unnecessary passages and a few unresolved details, but overall it's a captivating and creepy book.
