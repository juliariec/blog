## Review

Helpful overview on main financial issues that concern young people. The content was mostly useful to me and I liked the tone of the book too - will be a valuable resource over the next few years.

<b>2nd Read</b>: Enjoyed rereading this now that I know more about personal finance and have different goals. This time around, the most useful sections to me were on managing my investment accounts, getting the best deals from my bank, and thinking about saving up for future expenses.
