review: "There were certain qualities of this book I enjoyed, especially the attention to setting and each of the family members' individual relationship to Judaism and their family history. I think my favourite section was the last one, told from Varya's perspective. That being said, I didn't really emotionally connect to the novel the way I thought I might, and it seemed to fall a bit short of what it could have been."

## Review

There were certain qualities of this book I enjoyed, especially the attention to setting and each of the family members' individual relationship to Judaism and their family history. I think my favourite section was the last one, told from Varya's perspective. That being said, I didn't really emotionally connect to the novel the way I thought I might, and it seemed to fall a bit short of what it could have been.
