review: "A fun, enjoyable read! I've read a lot of spins on <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and this was one that had enough similarities while still offering originality in its premise, which I liked. At some points the plot seemed inconsistent with the characterizations, but overall Khalid and Ayesha were well written and I was invested in their story."

## Review

A fun, enjoyable read! I've read a lot of spins on _Pride and Prejudice_ and this was one that had enough similarities while still offering originality in its premise, which I liked. At some points the plot seemed inconsistent with the characterizations, but overall Khalid and Ayesha were well written and I was invested in their story.
