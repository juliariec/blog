## Review

Compelling characters that span a wide range of personalities and roles during the war in Berlin. I felt like this novel strongly communicated the sense of suspicion and surveillance that permeated the characters' communities. It also definitely showed the senselessness of the concepts of law and justice at the time.

<i>He might be right: whether their act was big or small, no one could risk more than his life. Each according to his strength and abilities, but the main thing was, you fought back.</i>
