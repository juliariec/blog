## Review

This novel was the height of vicarious enjoyment and even a kind of moral catharsis — an extended fantasy of the poor becoming rich, of good triumphing over evil, of justice being served — that was exciting and satisfying.

_'You don't believe in God, but you've just been struck down by God. You don't believe in God, yet all He asks of you is a prayer, a word, a tear in order to forgive you.'_
