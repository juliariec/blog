## Review

A lovely, surprisingly sad short story. There should be more joy in the world and more efforts to preserve it.

_Indeed, one young man who had only recently been appointed to the department and who, following the example of the others, tried to have some fun at his expense, stopped abruptly at Akaky's mild expostulation, as though stabbed through the heart; and since then everything seemed to have changed in him and he saw everything in quite a different light._
