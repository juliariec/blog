review: "Long story short, excellent book but not dense enough for my tastes. Csikszentmihalyi presents a clear and compelling thesis about the flow condition and its prerequisites, which I think is extremely valuable and relevant to everyday living. The book starts off strong and ends well but it seemed to me that some of the chapters in the middle were reiterations of the same points and could have been condensed further. Definitely still worth the read!<br/><br/><i>Flow drives individuals to creativity and outstanding achievement.

## Review

Long story short, excellent book but not dense enough for my tastes. Csikszentmihalyi presents a clear and compelling thesis about the flow condition and its prerequisites, which I think is extremely valuable and relevant to everyday living. The book starts off strong and ends well but it seemed to me that some of the chapters in the middle were reiterations of the same points and could have been condensed further. Definitely still worth the read!

_Flow drives individuals to creativity and outstanding achievement. The necessity to develop increasingly refined skills to sustain enjoyment is what lies behind the evolution of culture._
