## Review

Another story that just wasn't for me, although I think that readers with interest in the wilderness or survival would like it. Personal impressions: too many geographical details that didn't interest me, a lot of 'telling' about McCandless' personality/character rather than showing, and some thought-provoking quotes/passages.
