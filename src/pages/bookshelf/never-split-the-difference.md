## Review

For now, I'd say this book was a worthwhile read because I have no understanding of negotiation techniques and it offers a wide toolkit that I'm interested in trying out (can't speak yet to whether or not these techniques actually work).

My issue with the book is that it contained _way_ too many pointless stories about the FBI. The anecdotes about specific students using specific techniques in specific, real life circumstances were helpful examples of actual scripts for the tools. When it already had these, why did the book need to include so many long-winded descriptions of FBI hostage takeovers (or screw-ups)?
