## Review

This was an eye-opening and frankly quite distressing portrait of four Indians in Bombay during the Emergency. Exploring each of the characters' backstories to illuminate a wide range of issues was well done, but in general I found the writing weaker than the setup of the novel.

_In that optimistic first light, the promise of transformation shone down upon the sleeping city. He knew the feeling wouldn't stay more than a few minutes—he had experienced it before, it always faded under stronger light._
