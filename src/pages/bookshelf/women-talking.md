## Review

The premise of this book - women talking about what they should do about the sexual attacks on them and their families - was thought-provoking and engaging. I found that because I'm a Christian certain elements of their discussions really resonated with me. I had to pay close attention to follow the style of the dialogue, and I thought that at times the narrator's backstory was distracting.
