## Review

I liked the style of these stories, particularly the way that seemingly unrelated details or occurrences were mentioned but their meaning and significance left to the reader. At times the collection seemed repetitive... probably better read liberally staggered. My faves were "Hurricane Hazel", "Loulou", "Bluebeard's Egg", and "Unearthing Suite".
