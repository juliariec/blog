## Review

This book is an experience because it's so _odd_ — the private diary of a long-dead Very Important Person who spends a lot of time writing about "nature", complaining about having to deal with idiots, and musing about death. It seems weird to me that modern tech bros picked up this book, thought "yes, this is exactly the advice I needed", and adopted Stoicism as their life's philosophy, yet here we are.

My favourite parts: the beginning, where he lists out all the things he's learned from the people he knows, and his advice on the perennial dilemma of hearing someone mispronounce a word: instead of correcting them, you should just pronounce it correctly later in the conversation, and they'll catch their own mistake. #ancientwisdom
