review: "<b>2nd read:</b> This entire review will just be a paraphrase of a conversation I had with SK after rereading this, but here it is: I think the engaging element of Rooney's writing — the part that makes it difficult to put down the novel — is the exploration of power within social dynamics.

What I loved most about this novel was its depiction of the vulnerability that comes with knowing and loving other people deeply; a timely reminder that relationships can only be amazing when accompanied by the terrifying kind of honesty. I also loved the richness of the group dynamic and Felix's insistence on shaking things up. I wish that Simon had more of a presence in the story, but the moment between him and Eileen at Lola's wedding nearly made up for it. <br/><br/> <i>What if the meaning of life on earth is not eternal progress toward some unspecified goal — the engineering and production of more and more powerful technologies, the development of more and more complex and abstruse cultural forms?

## Review

<b>2nd read:</b> This entire review will just be a paraphrase of a conversation I had with SK after rereading this, but here it is: I think the engaging element of Rooney's writing — the part that makes it difficult to put down the novel — is the exploration of power within social dynamics. I think the emails languish a bit in this book because the characters themselves are not the most interesting part; it's only when the characters are put in relation to each other that they begin to fly.

<b>1st read:</b>Rooney's novels feel like answers to questions I didn't know that I had. What I loved most about this novel was its depiction of the vulnerability that comes with knowing and loving other people deeply; a timely reminder that relationships can only be amazing when accompanied by the terrifying kind of honesty.

_What if the meaning of life on earth is not eternal progress toward some unspecified goal — the engineering and production of more and more powerful technologies, the development of more and more complex and abstruse cultural forms? What if these things just rise and recede naturally, like tides, while the meaning of life remains the same always — just to live and be with other people?_
