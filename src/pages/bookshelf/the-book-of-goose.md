## Review

There's something about Li's writing that consistently enchants me; her novels always feel nostalgic but melancholy.

_Happiness, I would tell her, is to spend every day without craning one's neck to look forward to tomorrow, next month, next year, and without holding out one's hands to stop every day from becoming yesterday._
