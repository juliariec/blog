review: "Super practical book about maintaining good software design practices and working effectively on software projects. It covers a lot of ground and ranges from fairly basic to more technical (in my opinion), but the tips were connected by a common 'pragmatic' approach which I liked. Will definitely try to implement what I've learned and I'm sure I'll return to this one."

## Review

Super practical book about maintaining good software design practices and working effectively on software projects. It covers a lot of ground and ranges from fairly basic to more technical (in my opinion), but the tips were connected by a common 'pragmatic' approach which I liked. Will definitely try to implement what I've learned and I'm sure I'll return to this one.
