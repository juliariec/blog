## Review

This collection was framed by an introduction that referenced the capriciousness of gods and the razor edge between wonder and terror that defines sublimity; it felt to me that the stories flirted with this theme but never quite declared their intentions.

_Perhaps it was the circumstances of our creation. Perhaps we were not truly separate people but parts of a whole, as a thicket of aspen trees all grow from the same network of roots. And, even now, maybe it is no different._
