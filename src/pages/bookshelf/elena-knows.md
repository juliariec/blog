## Review

The thematic underpinning was interesting—a story that includes Parkinson's, suicide, and abortion to raise questions about bodily autonomy—but I found it unpleasant to read.

_"One day, some day, … life will test us. For real, not a dress rehearsal. And on that day we will finally realise that we are all alone, forced to face ourselves, with no lies left to cling to."_
