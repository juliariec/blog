review: "This was a birthday gift from a friend and I generally actually enjoy reading self help books, so I gave it a shot. There were some helpful ideas (like... believing in yourself...), and then a lot of irrelevant writing and/or advice I didn't find useful (like... manifest money so you can buy an Audi). Considering it only took me two hours to read it and I laughed a couple times, I feel like it was worth the motivating boost I got, but would not really recommend it in general."

## Review

This was a birthday gift from a friend and I generally actually enjoy reading self help books, so I gave it a shot. There were some helpful ideas (like... believing in yourself...), and then a lot of irrelevant writing and/or advice I didn't find useful (like... manifest money so you can buy an Audi). Considering it only took me two hours to read it and I laughed a couple times, I feel like it was worth the motivating boost I got, but would not really recommend it in general.
