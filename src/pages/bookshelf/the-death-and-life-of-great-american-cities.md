## Review

I found a lot of this book's content interesting, especially the emphasis on challenging norms and observing how cities actually operate. In particular, I really enjoyed the section at the end about strategies for approaching problems and considering cities as "organized complexity".

However, the book was quite long and took me a while to get through, and the chapters at the end were not as interesting to me. I'm sure that this book is more meaningful if you have some knowledge of the cities frequently referenced; I would love to read an equivalent on a city I was familiar with.
