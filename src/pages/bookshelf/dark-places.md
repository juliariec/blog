review: "I thought that this book was really well done. The storytelling style kept me constantly trying to piece together what had happened - I liked that as a reader you have enough information to work with when forming theories, and things keep on getting revealed as you go. Some parts were rather disturbing, and just the style and writing of the first few chapters made me feel grimy and unpleasant, but that was the point. Definitely an entertaining read."

## Review

I thought that this book was really well done. The storytelling style kept me constantly trying to piece together what had happened - I liked that as a reader you have enough information to work with when forming theories, and things keep on getting revealed as you go. Some parts were rather disturbing, and just the style and writing of the first few chapters made me feel grimy and unpleasant, but that was the point. Definitely an entertaining read.
