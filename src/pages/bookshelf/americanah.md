review: "Like most long books, this novel had a lot going on and some parts were definitely more interesting than others; that said, overall I found it engaging and I enjoyed following the stories of Ifemelu and Obinze. I especially enjoyed reading about the beginning of their relationship in high school, Ifemelu's observations about the US and initial experiences as an immigrant, and the relationship between her and Blaine. I didn't find Obinze to be quite as compelling of a character, but I liked seeing the contrast between his experience in the UK and hers in the US, and of course I was rooting for them to reunite in Nigeria by the end of the book."

## Review

Like most long books, this novel had a lot going on and some parts were definitely more interesting than others; that said, overall I found it engaging and I enjoyed following the stories of Ifemelu and Obinze. I especially enjoyed reading about the beginning of their relationship in high school, Ifemelu's observations about the US and initial experiences as an immigrant, and the relationship between her and Blaine. I didn't find Obinze to be quite as compelling of a character, but I liked seeing the contrast between his experience in the UK and hers in the US, and of course I was rooting for them to reunite in Nigeria by the end of the book.
