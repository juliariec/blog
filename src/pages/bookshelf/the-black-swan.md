## Review

This was an excellent read about intellectual humility and learning to recognize the limits of our own understanding, and I liked Taleb’s forceful, direct writing style.The most helpful lesson for me was how to distinguish from Mediocristan and Extremistan (_Mediocristan is where we must endure the tyranny of the collective, the routine, the obvious, and the predicted; Extremistan is where we are subjected to the tyranny of the singular, the accidental, the unseen, and the unpredicted._)
