## Review

Another beautiful read - I didn't enjoy it quite as much as _Circe_, but it was still great. I loved the way that the story played with the readers' foreknowledge of the Trojan War while managing to surprise. At times the style made the tale feel almost glossy, which created an interesting contrast with the content.

_He knew, but it was not enough. The sorrow was so large it threatened to tear through my skin. When he died, all things swift and beautiful and bright would be buried with him. I opened my mouth, but it was too late._
