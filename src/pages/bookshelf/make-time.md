## Review

'Make Time' is written in a distinctively light, conversational tone, which I found unusual but enjoyable. My biggest takeaway was the idea of picking a 'highlight' for the day and making that your focus; otherwise, the book had lots of good advice that I've already heard. Would recommend if you're interested in non-annoying productivity ideas and haven't already read a lot in the genre.

_You only waste time if you're not intentional about how you spend it._
