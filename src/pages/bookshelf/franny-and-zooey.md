## Review

Short and at times incredibly funny. I mostly disregarded the ideas discussed in the book in favour of the relationships in the novel, which were of much greater interest. My favourite part was when Zooey and his mother are having a conversation in the bathroom, and I think the few perfectly placed lines and moments in the stories made them worth reading. (Like the one I'm attaching to this review – pure gold.)

_Zooey rinsed his razor. 'Who in hell is Lane?' he asked. Unmistakably, it was the question of a still very young man who, now and then, is not inclined to admit that he knows the first names of certain people._
