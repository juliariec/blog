review: "This book was a collection of hit and miss for me, but in my opinion the hits compensate for the misses. It provides a useful framework for thinking about objects and for design principles, but the book itself seemed poorly structured and the connections between ideas were often obscured. I think the beginning of the book, concerned with affordances and signifiers, and some of the concepts for robust and intuitive design were the most insightful parts of the book. Worth a read!"

## Review

This book was a collection of hit and miss for me, but in my opinion the hits compensate for the misses. It provides a useful framework for thinking about objects and for design principles, but the book itself seemed poorly structured and the connections between ideas were often obscured. I think the beginning of the book, concerned with affordances and signifiers, and some of the concepts for robust and intuitive design were the most insightful parts of the book. Worth a read!
