## Review

I devoured this in a day—it was a balm for my soul as I panic about many outstanding tasks in my life.

_Once you give up on the unattainable goal of eradicating all your problems, it becomes possible to develop an appreciation for the fact that life just **is** a process of engaging with problem after problem, giving each one the time it requires—that the presence of problems in your life, in other words, isn't an impediment to a meaningful existence but the very substance of one._
