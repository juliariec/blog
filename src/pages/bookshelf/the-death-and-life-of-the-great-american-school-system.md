review: "An interesting and well researched book about the American educational system, specifically the poorly conceived and implemented legislation over the past few decades. Due to the scope and depth of the author's case, it's way too long if you're casually interested (like myself), but I definitely learned a lot.<br/><br/>There were frequent references made to 'high-performing nations' when it came to education and I think a more detailed comparison to those or an analysis of their strategies would have been helpful, especially in the section about moving forward, but also... it would have made the book longer.... so I'm not sure about that :)"

## Review

An interesting and well researched book about the American educational system, specifically the poorly conceived and implemented legislation over the past few decades. Due to the scope and depth of the author's case, it's way too long if you're casually interested (like myself), but I definitely learned a lot.

There were frequent references made to "high-performing nations" when it came to education and I think a more detailed comparison to those or an analysis of their strategies would have been helpful, especially in the section about moving forward, but also... it would have made the book longer.... so I'm not sure about that :)
