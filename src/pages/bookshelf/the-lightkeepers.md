review: "A pretty standard suspenseful novel about a nature photographer on an extremely isolated island. I liked the information about the different animals, and occasionally the descriptions of the setting, but the interpersonal plots didn't really engage me. I think that the description for the book was inaccurate, which gave me false hopes that the story didn't live up to. I liked it enough but not a lot."

## Review

A pretty standard suspenseful novel about a nature photographer on an extremely isolated island. I liked the information about the different animals, and occasionally the descriptions of the setting, but the interpersonal plots didn't really engage me. I think that the description for the book was inaccurate, which gave me false hopes that the story didn't live up to. I liked it enough but not a lot.
