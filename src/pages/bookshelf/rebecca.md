review: "Not the style of book I usually read, but I really enjoyed this one - it had beautiful writing and I loved the psychological forces at play in the story. In particular, the prominence of setting in the novel was unique and well done. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because although the inner musings of the main character are central to the themes and development of the novel, I found her so <i>annoying</i> during the middle chapters."

## Review

Not the style of book I usually read, but I really enjoyed this one - it had beautiful writing and I loved the psychological forces at play in the story. In particular, the prominence of setting in the novel was unique and well done. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because although the inner musings of the main character are central to the themes and development of the novel, I found her so _annoying_ during the middle chapters.
