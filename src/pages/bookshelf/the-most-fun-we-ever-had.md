review: "I really liked this novel - I quickly became invested in all of the characters' lives and watching the entire family drama unfold. I think Jonah's character was essential for providing an opening point into the closed family unit that the reader could identify with; his plotline was definitely the one I cared about the most. Another book that makes me kind of terrified to have a family."

## Review

I really liked this novel - I quickly became invested in all of the characters' lives and watching the entire family drama unfold. I think Jonah's character was essential for providing an opening point into the closed family unit that the reader could identify with; his plotline was definitely the one I cared about the most. Another book that makes me kind of terrified to have a family.
