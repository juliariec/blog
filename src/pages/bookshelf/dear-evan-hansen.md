review: "I saw the musical in Toronto in May and I really enjoyed it – I cared about the characters, liked the music, and I thought it was very relevant to current issues that teenagers face. Whenever I see a movie or show I really enjoy, my instinct is to find the book and see what new facets of the story it introduces - this book, as I found out after reading it, was based off of the musical, so it doesn't really have anything new in it other than more depth for Connor (which was good). Since I was hoping for a lot more, I was pretty disappointed with the book."

## Review

I saw the musical in Toronto in May and I really enjoyed it – I cared about the characters, liked the music, and I thought it was very relevant to current issues that teenagers face. Whenever I see a movie or show I really enjoy, my instinct is to find the book and see what new facets of the story it introduces - this book, as I found out after reading it, was based off of the musical, so it doesn't really have anything new in it other than more depth for Connor (which was good). Since I was hoping for a lot more, I was pretty disappointed with the book.
