## Review

First read: There were a host of things in this book that irritated me (some questionable decisions from the narrator, an unsatisfactory ending, etc), but certain things about that I really liked that pulled it up to 3 stars - the style, the detailed characterizations, the reflections in hindsight from the narrator, and certain sentences / paragraphs. In particular, I loved the chapter where Lee's parents visit her at school; to me, that chapter alone made the story worth reading.

Second read: Still enjoyed it but a little less the second time. Again I thought the dynamic of Lee with her family was well done. Definitely felt like shaking her vigorously a few times.
