review: "Overall, I liked this book – definitely some stories/essays over others. I liked the interesting, varied premises that the stories seemed to be centered on (like 'Challenger Deep'), and occasional details on the more conventional ones (like the thing about the 'cha cha chas' in 'The Ingenue'). As far as the nonfiction, I liked the one about the whales, and I especially liked that the book ended with launching your business card into space. "

## Review

Overall, I liked this book – definitely some stories/essays over others. I liked the interesting, varied premises that the stories seemed to be centered on (like "Challenger Deep"), and occasional details on the more conventional ones (like the thing about the 'cha cha chas' in "The Ingenue"). As far as the nonfiction, I liked the one about the whales, and I especially liked that the book ended with launching your business card into space.
