## Review

I wasn't convinced by the synopsis of this book, but I enjoyed _Normal People_ so much that I gave it a shot and I'm happy that I did. Frances' personality works perfectly with the style of the book, simultaneously detached and too vulnerable, which made the story feel very raw and distinctively mesmerizing to me.

_I hung up the phone. After that I put some cold water on my face and dried it, the same face I had always had, the one I would have until I died._
