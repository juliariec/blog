review: "This book is terrible — it's repetitive, simplistic, grating, and IMO pretty misguided. I would love to dunk on it further, but I don't want to fill my GR with negativity, so I'll keep it short: it's annoying to assume we all share a definition of what an 'extraordinary' life entails, it's silly to pretend that life isn't complex and dynamic, and it's super irritating to stylize 'one' as 'ONE' for 200+ pages."

## Review

This book is terrible — it's repetitive, simplistic, grating, and IMO pretty misguided. I would love to dunk on it further, but I don't want to fill my GR with negativity, so I'll keep it short: it's annoying to assume we all share a definition of what an 'extraordinary' life entails, it's silly to pretend that life isn't complex and dynamic, and it's super irritating to stylize 'one' as 'ONE' for 200+ pages.
