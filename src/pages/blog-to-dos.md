A list of to-dos I have for this blog:

- Migrate Gatsby from Remark to MDX (see [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/migrate-remark-to-mdx/))
- Set up a simple newsletter to notify readers when I post something new
- Configure a separate RSS feed for my book updates
- Submit my site to the [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/) page
- Add a new section called "Snippets" with shorter notes
- Add a new section called "Articles" or something with articles that I've read and my responses to them
- Roll out my own comment section so that people without GitHub accounts can write comments \[maybe\]
- Write a fun, interactive timeline for my "About" page \[maybe\]
- Once I have more blog posts:
  - Enable search for my posts
  - Curate my best ones and suggest them on my homepage
- Find some way to easily represent the "last modified" property for my posts
- Add a "Projects" page with projects from my GitHub account \[maybe\]
- Move my contact information to its own page and add a form for people to reach me
- Write my own guestbook? \[maybe\] (see [here](https://jameslittle.me/blog/2020/about-the-guestbook/))
- Update the "Bookshelf" page with the option to collapse review text so readers can scroll through just the titles
- Invent some way to designate "evergreen" content (like my blogroll)
